shiora of the binding eye
hawk mitsuki
that's why
you say you don't know
such a debt!
that being said
rene ...
i have a loan book over here
the money i borrowed from tortiano should be returned properly.
i know
the debt my dad made at the casino ...
that
maybe the tortiano family?
a?
it's being taken in, so come back again!
eh, that ...
please wait
ah
gat
tetteme ...!
i'm sorry ... i just fell down with an invisible "closed eye"
what is the purpose of the closed eyes for the mafia !!
uh, uh ...
my name is shiora and she is a gunman in the sink.
i heard the name of the tortiya family who divides the area here
could she hire me as a bouncer ...
the blind closed eyes ...
even a gunman ...?
king...
mafia licking is also almost always done
ah
is the closed eye a bouncer?
would you like to throw away the brain that was struck by the gun on her waist?
a?
oh, that ...
stop it for a moment! at this point!
...
hmm?
maybe you
is it a woman?
yeah ... yes ...
ho
show me your face
eh
even with closed eyes, if you are good at it, the trader will ...
just a little ...!
-!?
what the hell ...
you...
??
i'll show you anything !!
terrible!
are you okay?
i'm going home today
but i don't think you can do this forever
rene
are you stupid
you are
can you buy a gun arm for the tortiya family, which was created by shooting?
after all, selling fights to bill tortiya
he's one of the tortiya brothers, the most rough in the city
so that's it
the 7-foot giant was the younger brother of the mafia brothers ...
that's right!
i won't say bad things, so i'll just start from the city ...
... hmm? it's true that the height of the building is that much
i can't see, so i know exactly ...?
you can roughly tell by the direction of the voice and the weight of the footsteps.
you are a little heavier than your height of 5.7 feet and the three sizes are ...
naru
i don't know that much
it's a joke
... this isn't it
haha
then i'm about to
i have to find an inn tonight ...
it was
...
ahhh
thank you for the trouble
first of all, i'll get rid of that dingy look
eyes
if you don't want to see it, wrap it in a towel
thank you so much
i'll wash it
you don't know what to do with a shower in a person's house
...that
you're quite used to handling closed eyes, aren't you?
ah...
my dad also had bad eyesight
no...
to be exact, it got worse
he ’s a terrible father ...
because it would be money, i drew only the naked woman and wholesaled it to tortiya
but i'm sick and my eyes are getting worse and worse.
i think i was shocked as a painter
did the work decrease and the money run out and the grilling turned around?
the disposition of trying to model me
after all, gambling to hold down the debt and dobon to the river
a terrible father, right?
...in the end
is rene a model?
...ah
because it was persistent
it wouldn't have been a lot of money to draw me, but ...
yes...
that's good...
you must have been happy
i was able to draw my daughter before i couldn't see
rene-san?
it's nothing
the back is over
look, it's suitable for this
what about you more than that?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even that eye ...
it's not a big deal
i shot and killed the mafia who killed my parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown
this eye
at that time, as a proof of sin ...
...
maybe my eyes are crushed ...?
what a terrible ...
you just killed her parents!
she's nothing terrible, rene
it ’s not as tragic as your father ’s fragment.
i wanted blood for myself
i can't complain about what he did
why don't you throw away your gun!
even with such eyes !!
but
then ...
dispose of?
i already
she has only a gun and closed eyes
preparing dinner
call me if you have any inconvenience
i'm sure it's a lie ...
a lie that a beggar tells to attract attention
that's right ...
!!
but have you finished yet?
this is also the place i just made
guidance to your seat now
ー‼
rene-san, it's up now!
ai kaori
the smell of hamburger
that?
rene san
damn
let go
suddenly!
don't shout so rene
i think my younger brother told me a lot about the matter.
that's why there is no such thing as this
don tortiya !!
good grief
i wonder if that manly personality can be managed
well
you also got a buyer
buyer...?
the one who bought your father's picture loves you so much
i definitely want to buy you as a model
yorokoberene
if the buyer arrives in a few minutes, the debt will be chara
but
i don't know how it will be treated at the shipping destination.
whew
don't be foolish!
someone !!
haha
it's useless rene
nobody will come to scream in a warehouse on the outskirts of the city
jeez
i can't complain no matter what manuke does.
if my dad didn't suffer from his eyes
degree...
what do you mean ...
i won't see you anymore so i'll tell you
your father was in trouble because he had bad eyesight
he told me to buy the next picture high for the cost of treatment
i'm worried if i just make a verbal promise, so i prepared a contract
i'm just disappointed
i made a mistake on the paper
i don't even notice him who had bad eyesight
the contract i signed
he was a huge loan book
wait ... then dad ...
what is the value of a painter who has lost his eyesight?
i'm sorry, so i sent it to the other world!
i'm sure i'll be drawing angel nudes nowadays !!
a?
tete
the windows were higher than i expected ...
oi...
what's this guy ...
shiora !?
no
i'm sorry for late at night ...
rene-san here
i was picked up ...
oh big brother!
this is the strange closed eye i just reported!
what building
was it attached?
i told you to stick ...
this guy has eyes ...
it smells
the delicious scent of the hamburger steak made by rene
if you follow it and come here ...
it's full of the smell of boiled carrion
i feel very sick
if nothing is done, the supper will get cold.
without pulling out each other's guns
would you please return it to me
......
building
king
for boobs who can't see the situation at all
i have to remind myself with a lead bullet
sakiya licked like a closed eye
shioratsu !!
kutabare
i shot
that is first
bill !?
damn it
never let it go !!
kill me !!
...!? don't win !!
what will happen !!
pull the trigger so roughly
i know exactly where it will come from
uo !!
hi
this guy
it's not a closed eye !!
it's a binding eye !!
binding eyes ...?
no way ...
i've heard of it...
there was a gunman who killed all the mafia in a city from revenge ...
the people in the city who were afraid of its power
burned eyes, sewn eyelids and kicked him out of town
that poor gunman is ...
he's still shooting around villains like a ghost ...
is this the one ...?
binding eye shooter
no way such a kid ...
jeez
which one is not visible
despise with closed eyes
manuke
this guy's light ...
please stay still
rene
this is already
because it's the darkness of the closed eyes
hah
hah
hah
hah
i'm alive ...
but
only me?
are you injured?
rene
ah
damn
my
my family
why is this ...
why ...?
do not be silly...
then why
dad is dead !!
wait a minute
don't shoot
die!
i'm not dead !!
why...
why !!
shiora !!
this guy has a dad ...
rene
if you pull the trigger
be prepared
chikusho ...
it was saved
shiora
i heard you want me to hire you
now at your asking price ...
did you just say "why"?
"why" in that b
it's humorous
i'm not prepared to that extent
below the outer road

damn it
hmm
in the dark
continue to regret for the rest of your life
didn't you say good?
don't bother to see off
i have to say thank you
i did it without permission
do you want to continue ... shooting people
yes...
to this eye
......
it's a lot of luggage to see off
ah
i'm leaving the city
i'm depressed even if i'm here
that is...
where on earth ...?
where you go
are you happy?
it's no good
like living with blood
if you were with someone like me ...
cheap sympathy ...
don't get me wrong
i don't know what happened to you a long time ago
i don't think i can withdraw your hand
isn't it permissible for the benefactor to cook rice again?
but...
after all
i'm lonely with each other
going the road alone
here we go..
there will be a train
the wings of a dream
hardened with wax
the higher you fly
will be melted by the sun
-if so
you had better not fly from the beginning
be sure to someday
it's a failure !!
manned rocket "asagao" explodes!
because it falls to the ground
japan's first manned space flight has failed !!
balloon dream
hawk mitsuki
ten years later-summer
hitoshi aikawa
you have the academic ability to aim for a first-class university
but why are you aiming for a third-class recommendation?
i really have no dreams
dream ...? stupid
if there is an easy and safe way, you should choose it
am i wrong?
good! aikawa ...
for a cute student like you
easy to ask for various things
??
during the summer vacation for you
get help from my astronomical department
??
a little
why don't you help club activities that have nothing to do with it?
well listen
i know you like hitting ishibashi and crossing
if you don't enter the tiger hole in the world, you won't get a tiger child.
the teacher wants to teach you that
so i ask the astronomical club while the teacher goes to the hot springs
you're just traveling !!
little ~
why am i doing this ...
if you don't help, don't recommend it
it's not a threat, that power harassment teacher !!
... astronomical department
here
excuse me
hmm?
uoooooooooo !?
what is this !?
...balloon?
i'm sorry i'm messy now
are you a helper?
welcome!
to the astronomical club full of balloons and dreams!
again!
i'm mizuki sonoyama, the director!
i heard from your teacher, mr. aikawa.
thank you for your cooperation.
no
likewise!?
what's this guy ...
is there any other member !?
i'd like to get into the main subject at once.
go home ~
see you !!
with balloons
i raise the camera to space !!
camera?
with balloons
i saw it on tv before!
fluffy and camera go to space with balloons ...
the balloon broke and fell off with a parachute ...
if you collect the camera, you can take a picture of the earth!
isn't it really exciting?
naru
what was that bonkura teacher who helped me a little !!
push it against the troublesome guy ... !!
??
in addition...
that's why there are a lot of balloons.
please inflate aikawa a lot!
that's right
however, no matter how many aired balloons you collect, they won't float !!
mugu
this guy is absolutely stupid
.......?
what are you doing !?
if you don't put in helium, the balloons won't float !!
why is it a disposable camera?
ah
because it was cheap ...
do you feel like you can wind the film in space and release the shutter !?
geez
it may be possible in principle, but ...
there are many pictures of the earth on the net.
i didn't bother to shoot it myself ...
ah
that's ...
my dream is
because as an astronaut, you see the round earth.
this is the first step to a dream
that's why i really want to take a picture myself
i can talk about my dreams like that
only those who have never seen the end of their dreams
you know if you're aiming for an astronaut
ten years ago
japan's first manned rocket "morning glory" failed to launch
just putting a person on the rocket without much reward
risk and cost jump
i failed and many people suffered
manned space flight
it ’s an idiot who does n’t think ahead.
i'm sorry
i'm going to say this ...
it's okay
still for me
because it's an important dream
help me ...
i'll help you properly
recommendation ...
i have to take it
it ’s amazing!
the camera is really flying !!
now you can take pictures of the earth ..... !!
no, i can't take it
i said today was just a test shoot
is that so !?
listen to me!
it's a high hurdle to fly high suddenly
first of all, i have to get a feel for it ...
the production is a stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters using huge balloons that can withstand the decrease in atmospheric pressure.
because it will be swept away by the air current
go to the drop point with gps
this time, if you go out, pull the octopus thread and collect it.
oh ... i see
......
mr. aikawa
hmm?
help
very
thank you
......
i have no choice but to recommend .... !!
that?
something
a strange response ...
acha
this is...
did the thread break ...
i can't do anything about this ...
what should i do
i have to chase ...
no, no
the contents are a 2,000 yen toy camera
and around here it just falls into the mountains or fields
it costs more to look for
no
because that's important ...
my important thing is ...
...you
did you get something on your own?
i'm sorry! i really want to bring it to space
it ’s very light ...
but i'm sure it will be opposed
of course!
this is a proper weight calculation!
you do it yourself ... !!
aikawa-san ...
me
i'm going to look for
i heard from a while ago
just say fluffy things
can you go out with me !!
this balloon woman !!
after work, i always go looking for it ...
very...
stupid guy
......
what is a dream
i'm back
welcome back dad!
jin
was it still awake?
because my dad never came back ...
i'm working too hard
is that so?
"morning glory"
because it ’s my dad ’s dream
i fell down with all my heart and just ...
even though he was in charge of rocket development, he was blamed for that ...
what is japan's first launch trip?
it ’s the worst ending.
i'm sure in the other world
i wish i had done it
that...
aikawa-san?
did you still have it?
sonoyama ...?
you're soaked
ehehe
today as well...
could not be located
??
hey !!
you
it's a great fever !?
don't look for it until this happens!
why is this useless thing ... !!
for the time being, in the infirmary ...
......
wrong
it's not wasteful ...
hey
because
my
my...
because it's a dream
sonoyama ...
......
excuse me
mr. aikawa
i feel sick
up
wait a minute, sonoyama ahhhhh !!
what!?
i want to relax because i'm on my way home from a trip !?
i'm an adviser, so get out of the car !!
geez
for the time being, secure your feet to the point of fall
it's about time to prepare for the launch!
the tension is low !!
uh ... if i fell asleep due to a cold, i couldn't help but on the day of the launch
after all, i couldn't find a prototype ...
no matter what
there was something i wanted to raise in space ...
ora
raise your face
this is it
the important thing you put in
it was sold ten years ago
limited key chain of "morning glory"
i was curious
what are you so particular about?
so i searched for it while you were asleep
no way to take a picture of the earth
i'm trying to make a memorial service for a rocket
oh my god ...
look
i'll put it on, so i'll prepare quickly!
for me too ...
it's important
...one
tell me
having that key chain
you also saw
where "asagao" falls
why calmly
i can say i want to be an astronaut
"morning glory" which was a dream of various people
it was a wing of a spoof that was hardened with wax
you'll be worried if you see that
if you fail, you lose everything
it ’s scary, normal ...
frustration
regret
my wings
what to do if it is a fake
is not
fake wings
when i couldn't fly
what really hurts when a wing breaks
i'm sure it
because it's a real wing
that suffering is a proof that i was fluttering.
so i
regret
will not die
there were...
was!!
did it really go up to space?
what is it?
are you suspicious
no! that's not the case ...
well that's
you can tell by checking the contents
the earth was blue
it is a feeling...
haha
my mother...
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
eh !!
i said something strange !?
no sman
no way really
i didn't think i could shoot with balloons
that
mr. aikawa
hmm?
thank you very much
i'm stupid, so i'm a piggyback ride on mr. aikawa
it's just selfish ...
let me even put the treasure ... !!
very...
okay
surely
no big deal
why compared to this scenery
i'm sure it's not a big deal
i will stop recommending
i'll study more and make it
a rocket that even a fool like you can go to space
i
i'll make it
hi
what is a fool of a person !!
you
you said it yourself!
wow...
i'm glad it wasn't my neighborhood ~
i'm sorry ...
welcome
oh ... i'm sorry ...
it's really hard !!!
what's wrong !? does it hurt your stomach?
uh ...
the rice balls i picked up ...
my girlfriend ...
food poisoning ...
you see, i'll lend you a toilet, so why don't you take a rest?
i'm sorry ...
well ...
the store where i lived and worked was destroyed by a fire
when i got lost on the road and ate ...
i'm sorry for being trouble for you
no, it was a disaster
did it get a little easier?
yes!
that's right! i'll pay for the drink
oh, i don't need a bill ...
that?
that!?
there is no such thing ...
ah...
...
would you like to work at home if you don't have a destination?
okay!?
i wonder if i can prepare rice and a bed ...

i see ... i see ...
i wonder if it will grow ...
is there anything else you want?
hmm ...
peeling vegetables ...
peeler?

if you have a peeler, you can peel it off.
then help me cook more

ah yeah onions ...
i broke my stomach and went to the drugstore
thank you

this boy who was hired as a matter of course
he seems to have lost his job and place to live in the fire
the contents of the backpack he had only
luggage is it all?

it's okay if you grow taller
really amazing
other things like a sweater so that it's not cold ...

i'll cut the price tag
excuse me
next, let's go to the cooking utensil shop ~
high-strength

i'm out of my fingers ...

funeral director
people are not equal
however...
[death] visits everyone equally
well then

it could not be
i don't think he will come this much
a!
that's a snack mom in 1-chome!
the landlady of your favorite store!
i'm still a popular person!
it will come alive!
what is a funeral director?
work to create the final place for the living and the dead
..already
i am among them
i'm dead, right?
welcome to the ghost funeral shop
"visible" human beings
huh?
makeup for your deceased sister?
karasuma kuru, president of karasuma funeral company, 25 years old
yes...
funeral client sakurano suzume, 19 years old
angel makeup
that's right
i know it's impossible
but by all means i
i want to make up my sister ...
huh
i'm not a professional yet ...
makeup eggs that go to vocational school!
you can do it properly! karasuma-san
you should stop
!!
i have never met a "living girlfriend"
it must have been a beautiful face
why !?
sparrow
it seems that your sister was a famous beautiful actress.
the media is making noise every day
... for me
do you mean you aren't strong enough to make up her sister?
haha that's why
face after the accident of your sister
did you see it?
that's right
...house
from the hospital
i was told that i shouldn't look too much ...
the current sakurano swallow
she's not the face you know
car accident
it is also a head-on collision with the guardrail due to overspeed
her face is torn to pieces with a broken windshield
a broken bone is breaking through her skin
although simple treatment is done at the hospital
no one will notice her older sister
after seeing her face, "i can't do it"
then i'm in trouble
.....i am
how is it?
nevertheless
are you prepared to face your sister now?
a little funeral director!

don't bully sparrows too much !?
i'm my sister!
... swallow
you asked me, right?
not natural!
i don't want to see such a terrible face in a sparrow!
i'm used to being hated by others
but i don't want to be drawn by my sister
is that so ...
don't let sparrows do their own makeup
what
but why don't you think about mr. suzume's feelings?
she's a family of only two
... to you
what do you know
anyway!
i don't admit it !!
please make another proxy!
and ...
and?
... nothing !!
......anyone
farewell full of regrets
i'm lonely
welcome!
beautiful actress sakurano swallow died in a car accident

because she was a weirdo in the entertainment world
what?
well, so-called pillows .... newcomer pickles.

isn't it really good?
i'm sure my face and acting ability
what's inside ... hey?

it's our specialty!
you go to a vocational school while earning yourself
it costs money to go to school! i can't take a day off

.....
a...

ghosts
i have a fixed place to stay
the first is the place where he died
the second is where the ashes are buried
and the third is
beside a loved one
what?
i'm actually here
older sister
n/a
do funeral directors also call it a joke?
please call me kururu
mr. kiki ...
teeth
don't you feel bad about her sister?
there are various rumors, but ...
rumors are rumors?
you just have to ask the truth
mr. kiki is interesting
......me too
i was riding until just before
in the car of my sister who caused the accident
on the way back from my part-time job
the forecast is cloudy and then heavy rain ...
even though i'm busy with work
"because it's my birthday, let's go eat somewhere"
you came to pick me up
but i had a quarrel with my sister
... for tuition
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved
however
i didn't ask my sister to pay everything
her parents are dead
she became an older sister who took the place of her parents
she didn't want to bother me anymore ...
she's still a kid
she said so
about muka
hey! sparrow
she jumped out of the car
i hate you
what an older sister
that is
it was the last word i said to my sister
sister's accident
was it because of too much speed?
she think she was probably chasing me
after i got out of the car and ran
it's raining a lot
...my dream is
i was in charge of making up my sister on stage
but
it doesn't come true anymore
because of me
because of me...
she died
until the end
annoying my sister ...
... whether it's annoying or not
you don't decide for yourself, right?
how is it actually?
swallow
was it annoying?
....?
"if you think it's annoying"
"i won't be on my side"
"you know your sister best?"
because
... mysterious
i saw my sister for a moment
mr. kiki ...
can she ask again
if you are prepared to accept all of your sister
i was able to
hey ~
can i open my eyes already?
yes!
today's makeup
i'm confident!
...ns
ahaha!
bad
... i did my best
it's still a long time before i can become my exclusive makeup
i can be too !?
in charge of makeup for your sister!
hey
life isn't that sweet
when i can make makeup that will satisfy me
you can think about it
i'll reward you when that time comes
really!?
so at best
brush your arms!
swallow
it was beautiful
..... i'm always beautiful
what are you doing
i wasn't even on the side of mr. suzume
why, of course!
i didn't want to see such a face in a sparrow
i don't want to fulfill my request from the beginning
it wasn't
if your real request
it came true
huh...?
kiki-san
thank you very much!

??
......older sister
but...?
it ’s her birthday present that i was trying to give to you.
swallow
i'm sure i was trying to give it when i had dinner together
found from outside the car
i kept it here as a relic of my sister
even in an accident
only this was miraculously unscathed
surely
your sister was protecting me
..... i don't say thank you
you are also stubborn
you are a big help
high high
.....why
isn't it painful?
you're doing this kind of work
look at someone's crying face every day
say condolences to strangers
... not really
you
can she smile?
...really
nosy funeral director
...thank you
the sound of civilization echoes
when the book of dark night is paid
the evil spirit rakshasa never ceases
no
the light of a person covers the world
the delusion that is the source of evil spirits is widespread in the world.
kureha

for that
our rakshasa hunting
rakshasa hunter
hiroya ato

hawk mitsuki
in addition, it seems that the guy in fuji has done it alone
the evil spirit drifting around
what a grudge
it would have been a very powerful demon
however
as expected, rakshasa hunting from the dai onmyoji family
what is that giant devil burning?
just like a demon
hey, if you tell him something like a demon, he'll be killed.
since my family was eaten by evil spirits
i hate genuine demons
but it's not a mistake
that eye
in his heart, the demon will surely eat the nest
if a demon has eaten in your heart ...
that is
stop it!

i'll let you go home
i don't want to lay it on my butt for a while
kureha ...
i'm weak
when i defeated kagamimaru, it looked great
i don't know when i'll lose sight of myself again and hurt you
i already have
qualifications to handle you, etc.

i'm aware of the softness of children
you might get off the road on a moonless night
i'm here for such a time
serving aito from the world of heian
early millennium
chitose's feelings
it ’s your fire!
so that's it...
