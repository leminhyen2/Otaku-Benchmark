the binding eye, shiola.
kuchitaka mitsuki
that's why
i told you i don't know.
i don't owe you anything!
you say that, but...
raine...
i have a tenure over here.
you'll have to pay back the money you borrowed from tortillano.
i don't give a fuck.
the debt my father made at the casino...
um... um...
are you from the tortillano family?
huh?
i'm busy! come back later!
huh? u-umm...
please wait--
ah..!
*gah*
damn you...!
i'm sorry. i tripped over something i couldn't see.
what the hell do you want with the mafia?!
uh, uh...
i'm shiola, the drifter gunman.
i heard the name of the tortillas that run the area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as your bouncer.
the blinded closed eyes...
gunman...?
oh, um...
don't underestimate the mafia.
ah..!
a guard with closed eyes?
want to try throwing out your brains from the gun on your hips?
huh?
u-um...
don't do that! not here!
it's...
hm?
are you perhaps...
a woman?
yes... that's right, but...
oh, my god.
show me your face.
eh?
even with closed eyes, if you're good looking, your trade hand is...
hey, hey...!
huh?!
what the hell is this...
you bastard...
huh?
how dare you show me that!!
oh, my god! oh, my god!
are you all right?!
i'm going home today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
raine.
you idiot.
you're...
can you buy a gun arm for the tortilla family after a shootout?
and then you pick a fight with bill tortilla.
he's one of the tortilla brothers, the roughest bastards in town.
oh, i see.
that seven-foot-tall giant was the mafia's brother...
that's what i'm talking about!
i won't say anything bad, so get the hell out of town...
...hm? well, that's about the height of a building, but...
how can you tell so clearly when you can't see...?
the direction of the voice and the weight of the footsteps.
you're a little heavier than a 5'7 foot tall, and your three sizes are...
huh?
do you really know that much?
i'm just kidding.
...it's not hard.
haha.
well, i think it's time.
i need to find a place to stay tonight.
ouch!
it's...
ah, geez.
here's a little something for your trouble.
i'll take care of that filthy outfit first.
memoto
if you don't want me to see you, you'll need a towel.
<unk>th-thank you very much<unk>"
i'll wash it for you.
you don't know what to do with someone else's shower.
uh... um...
you're quite used to handling closed eyes.
uh... yeah.
my dad had bad eyesight, too.
no, it's...
it got worse, to be exact.
he was a terrible father - a humble painter.
he only painted naked women for money and sold them to tortillas.
but he got sick and his eyes got worse and worse.
it must have been a shock for her.
you've lost a lot of work, you've lost a lot of money, and you're burning up.
he's trying to model me.
after all, he was gambling and had debts in the river.
you're a terrible father, right?
in the end...
are you a model, rene?
uh... yeah.
it's because you're persistent.
i don't think i could've made that much money, but...
i see...
that's good to hear...
you must have been very happy.
i was able to draw your daughter before she became blind
raine?
iit's nothing.
back's over.
come on, look at me.
more importantly, what about you?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even those eyes...
it's no big deal.
he shot and killed the mafia that killed his parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown for that crime.
this eye...
then i'll have to prove my guilt.
it's...
or should i say, having my eyes blinded...?
oh, my god...
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing terrible going on, raine.
not as tragic as a piece of your father.
i am a heretic who sought blood of my own volition.
i can't complain about what he's done to me.
why don't you just drop the gun!
even after what happened!!
but...
well, in that case...
throw it away?
i've had enough.
all you have is a gun and a closed eye.
i'll go get dinner ready.
let me know if you need anything.
it's got to be a lie.
a lie a beggar would tell to attract attention.
of course i am...
huh? !
y-you're done already?
i just did.
i'm taking you to your seat now.
!!
raine-saaan, i just got out!
good morning, kaori.
it smells like hamburgers.
huh?
raine!
shit.
let go of me!
what's this all of a sudden?
don't yell at me like that, raine.
i'm sure my brother told you a lot of things.
but that doesn't mean you have to go this far.
don. tortilla!!
oh, my god.
can't you do something about his masculine personality?
oh, well.
and you've got a buyer.
a buyer...?
you know, your father's paintings have made me very fond of you.
i would love to buy you as a model.
be glad, raine.
when the buyer arrives in a few hours, the debt will be settled.
of course.
i don't know how they'll handle the shipment, though.
hmph.
don't screw with me!
s-someone!!
yes, sir.
it's no use, rene.
no one's going to come crying in a warehouse on the outskirts of town.
jesus christ.
idiots can't complain no matter what they do.
if your father didn't suffer from an eye disease, he would have let you live.
wh...
what do you mean by...
you'll never see him again, so i'll tell you.
your father had a bad eye for trouble.
i said i'd buy you the next painting for your medical expenses.
i also prepared a contract for you because i thought you'd be uneasy with just verbal promises.
it's just that i've been careless.
i got the wrong piece of paper.
you didn't even notice him when he had a bad eye.
the contract i signed
i didn't know it was such a large loan.
<unk>wait, wait... my father<unk>"
what's a painter who loses his eyesight worth?
i sent you to the other side because i feel sorry for you!
she's probably drawing some angel nudes by now!!
huh?
ow! ow!
the window was taller than i thought...
hey...
what's with this guy...?
shiola?!
no, no, no, no.
i'm sorry to bother you so late...
this is renesan.
i came to pick you up, but...
ah, brother!
that's the strange closed eye i just reported!
what the hell, bill?
did they follow you?
even if you try to poke it...
this guy's got eyes.
it's the smell.
the delicious smell of the hamburger that renee made...
i followed it all the way here...
it smells like rotten meat.
i don't feel so good.
at this rate, dinner's going to get cold.
we didn't pull our guns out.
please let me go home peacefully.
......
bill.
oh, yeah.
you don't even know what's going on.
i'll have to use lead bullets to teach him a lesson.
you're the loki that closed eyes licked.
shiorah!!
fuck you.
the one who shot him...
that's what we'll do first.
bill?!
get your shit together.
don't let them get away!!
kill him!!
...!? i can't hit it!!
what's going on?!
don't pull the trigger so roughly.
i know exactly where they're coming from.
uoooh!!
hii!
this guy...
don't close your eyes!!
it's a binding eye!!
a binding eye...?
no way ...
i've heard of it...
there was a gunman who murdered a city mafia out of revenge...
the people in the city who feared his power
i burned his eyelids and drove him out of town.
that poor gunman...
they say he's still shooting the bad guys like a ghost...
is it this guy...?
the shooter with the binding eyes.
no way a brat like this ...
jesus christ.
which one of you can't see?
eyes closed, eyes closed.
you idiots.
this light...
stay still, okay?
miss renee.
we're done here.
because it's closed eyes.
huh?
huh?
huh?
huh?
he's alive...
but, um...
am i the only one?
are you hurt?
miss renee.
yeah. yeah.
shit.
my...
my family.
why did this have to happen?
why...?
don't fuck with me...
then why?
dad is dead!!
whoa, whoa, whoa.
don't shoot me.
die!
dieeeeee!!
why are you...
why?!
shiola!!
he killed my dad...
miss renee.
if you pull the trigger
be prepared for anything.
damn it...
you saved me.
shiola, i think.
i hear you want me to hire you.
now, i'll give you your price.
did you just say why?
and i was like, why?
that's hilarious.
i can't believe you don't have that kind of resolve.
gedo (a heretic) or lower
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
damn it.
hmph.
in the dark.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
i told you it's okay.
you didn't have to see me off.
i should at least thank you.
i did it on my own.
you're going to continue... shooting people.
yeah, um...
by my eyes.
......
that's a lot of luggage to see you off.
yeah. yeah.
i'm leaving town, too.
it's depressing to be here.
well, that's...
where the hell are we going...?
where are you going?
you're happy, right?
no, you can't.
and it's kind of like we're living with our blood running through our hands
if you're with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't think i can pull your hand.
you're allowed to cook again, aren't you?
but...
i knew it.
we both miss each other.
i don't want to go down the street alone.
i don't know..
the train's leaving.
the wings of dreams
it's waxed.
the higher you fly
it's going to melt into the sun.
- well, then.
it's better not to fly in the first place.
someday, i'm sure.
it's a failure!!
manned rocket, asagao, explodes!
because it's falling to the ground.
japan's first manned space flight has failed!!
balloon dream.
kuchitaka mitsuki
ten years later, in the summer...
aikawa hitoshi
you have the academic ability to aim to be a firstclass college.
so why are you after a recommendation from a third-rate university?
i don't have any dreams.
a dream...? nonsense.
if there's a safe, easy way out, you should take it.
am i wrong?
that's good, aikawa...
for a cute little student like you
it's easy to ask for things.
huh?
during the summer vacation.
you'll help our astronomy club.
huh?
hey! hey!
why are you helping out with club activities that don't concern you?
well, listen to me.
i know you like hitting the stone bridge.
if you don't go into the tiger's den, you won't get torako.
that's what he wants to teach you.
so while you're at the hot spring, take care of the astronomy club.
you just want to travel, right?!
goddamn it!
why do i have to do this?
if you don't help me, i won't recommend you.
isn't that harassment?!
...tenmonbu
here, huh?
excuse me.
hm?
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?
wh-what the hell is this?!
...a balloon?
i'm sorry, it's a mess.
oh, are you helping out?
welcome, sir!
to the astronomy club, filled with dreams and balloons!
let's do it again!
i'm the boss, sonoyama mizuki!
you're aikawasan, right?
i look forward to working with you.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
same here! what?
what's with this guy...?
is there no one else in the club?!
i'd like to get straight to the point.
go home.
ta-daaa!!
balloons.
bring the camera up into space!!
the camera?
balloons.
i saw it on tv before!
the balloon floats and the camera goes into space...
a balloon popped and parachuted down...
i retrieved the camera and took a picture of earth!
aren't you excited?
huh?
what kind of help is that idiot teacher?!
she's pushing it onto someone who's such a pain...!!
huh?
besides...
that's why there are so many balloons!
mr. aikawa, please swell up a lot too!
come on, man.
no matter how many balloons we gather, there's no way they'll float!!
mgh!
he's an idiot.
............?
what are you so shocked for!?
if you don't put helium in, the balloon won't float!!
why is it a disposable camera in the first place!?
ah..!
it was so cheap.
are you going to roll up a film in space and take a picture!?
jeez.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there are tons of pictures of earth on the internet.
you don't have to take it yourself.
yeah. yeah.
well, that's...
my dream.
is to become an astronaut and look at the round earth.
this is the first step to a dream.
that's why i really want to take pictures of myself.
i think it's really hard to talk about dreams like that
only people who've never seen a dream come true.
if you're aiming to be an astronaut, you should know.
ten years ago--
failed to launch the first manned rocket in japan, 'asagao.'
you don't get much in return. you just put people in a rocket.
the risk and the cost will rise.
a lot of people have suffered because of a mistake.
manned space flights.
it's what idiots do when they don't think about the consequences.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to say...
it's okay. it's okay.
but to me
it's an important dream.
i can't help you...
i'll be sure to help you.
recommend...
i have to take it.
wow!!
the camera is really flying!!
i never thought i'd be able to take pictures of earth with this...!!
no, no, no, no. i can't take that.
i told you it's just a test shoot today.
huh, really!?
listen to what i have to say!
it's hard to fly high all of a sudden.
first, we need to get a feel for it.
the real thing is a 30,000meter stratosphere using a huge balloon that can withstand a decrease in atmospheric pressure.
you'll be swept away by the air currents.
i'm gonna turn off the gps and go look for him at the drop.
if you do a little more this time, pull an octopus thread and collect it.
oh... i see.
......
mr. aikawa.
hm?
help
i mean, really.
thank you very much.
......
i had no choice but to do it because of the recommendation...!!
huh?
something's wrong.
i felt something strange.
oh, my god.
this is...
the thread's been cut...
this is hopeless...
what should i do?
i have to go after him.
no, no, no, no. it's okay.
it's a 2000 yen toy camera.
and around here, you're just gonna fall into the mountains or the fields.
it costs a lot of money to find it.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
because it's important to that...
something important to me...
...you.
did you get something?
i'm sorry! i want to go into space no matter what!
it's very light.
but i'm sure they'll object.
of course it is!
i'm doing a proper weight calculation!
you did that on your own...!!
aikawasan...
i'm...
i'll go look for him.
i've been listening for a while now.
don't be so fuzzy.
i can't go out with her!!
you balloon woman!!
she always goes looking for me after work...
really...
you're such a fool.
......
what kind of dream is that?
i'm home.
welcome back, dad!
jin
you're still awake.
but my dad hasn't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
<unk>really? well, can't be helped<unk>"
and asagao
it's your father's dream.
he collapsed due to anxiety ... as it is.
even though she's in charge of developing the rocket, she's been put at the brink of criticism so much...
to trip over the first launch in japan.
that's the worst thing that could happen.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i wish i hadn't done that.
huh? what?
aikawasan?
you're still here?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
ehehe.
today, too...
i couldn't find it.
huh?
hey!!
you.
she's burning up!!
don't look for me until it's this bad!
why are you wasting your time...?!!
for now, let's go to the infirmary...
......
no, no, no, no.
it's not a waste of time...
whoa, whoa.
'cause...
my...
my...
because it's a dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry, sir.
mr. aikawa.
i'm gonna throw up.
upuu
w-wait, sonoyamaaaaa!!
huh?!
i'm on my way back from a trip, so i wanna take it easy!?
you're the advisor, so at least drive!!
jeez.
for now, let's secure the footing to the drop point
it's about time to prepare for the launch-
hey, don't be so down!!
ugh... i was sleeping with a cold, and before i knew it, the day of the launch
we didn't find any prototypes...
no matter what.
there was something i wanted to give the universe.
hey! hey!
get your head up.
it's gotta be this.
the important thing you put in
sold 10 years ago.
the morning glory limited key chain.
i've been wondering.
i don't know why you're so obsessed with it.
that's why i was looking for you while you were sleeping.
no way, while taking pictures of the earth
i can't believe you're trying to hold a memorial service for your rocket.
aaaaaaaaaaaikawa-shan...
here you go.
i'm gonna put it on you. let's get ready!
for me, too.
it's important to me.
...one thing.
let's hear it.
the fact that you have that key chain means
you were watching, too.
where asagao falls
how can you be so calm?
i can say i want to be an astronaut.
the dream of many people, asagao
it was a wax-coated tama's wings.
i'm sure you'd be worried if you saw that.
if we fail, we lose everything.
isn't that scary?
or frustration.
regret.
my own wings.
what if it's a fake?
no, sir.
fake wings.
when i can't fly
what really hurts when the wing breaks
i'm sure that's it.
because it's a real wing.
that pain is proof that he was struggling.
that's why i'm here
regrets.
even if it kills me.
there it is...
there it is!!
did it really go up into space?
wh-what the hell?
are you doubting me?
no! that's not what i meant...
well, that's...
we'll see what's inside.
the earth was blue.
that's what it feels like...
yes, sir.
haha...
hahahahahahahahaha
whaaat?!
did i say something strange?!
no, i'm sorry.
no way, really?
i didn't think i'd be able to take pictures with balloons.
um...
mr. aikawa.
hm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i'll carry aikawasan on my back.
even though it's just selfish...
you even let me have my treasure...!!
really...
it's okay. it's okay.
i'm sure of it.
it's not a big deal.
why, compared to this scenery
i'm sure it's no big deal.
i'm gonna stop recommending you.
i'll study more and make more.
a rocket that even an idiot like you can go into space.
i'll take care of it.
i'll make it for you.
hii!
don't call me an idiot!!
you...!
you just said it yourself!
wow. wow.
i'm glad it wasn't my neighborhood.
i'm sorry...
welcome, sir.
i-it's medicine...
she's at her wit's' end!!!
what's wrong?! does your stomach hurt?
ugh...
when i ate the rice ball i picked up
you idiot...
<unk>food, eh<unk>"
here, i'll let you use the restroom. why don't you take a break?
sorry to bother you...
let's see...
the shop that used to work there was destroyed by fire.
i'm told he ate out on the street.
i'm sorry to bother you.
no, no, no. that was a disaster.
feeling a little better?
yeah!
oh yeah! i'll pay for the drink
oh, i don't need the money...
huh?
huh?!
i don't have time for this.
uh...
it's...
if you don't have a place to work, why don't you work for us?
are you sure!?
i wonder if i could prepare some food and beds... if that's all right with you.
that's more than enough.
the manager saved my life.
you're exaggerating, hahaha...
what's your name?
it's mel!
<unk>i'll help you out first<unk>"
ii!!
yeah, i'll be counting on you starting tomorrow.
yes. yes.
don't burn yourself. it's hot.
ugh... delicious... delicious...
i'm glad i had a stomachache.
are you sure it's okay?
i guess it's okay.
thank you very much!
do your best to be of use to me.
an alarm clock...
you like frogs?
yeah. yeah.
good night. good night.
whaaaa!?
an alarm clock...
what a fiendish volume...
how can you sleep with this sound?
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
it's...
maybe he was tired.
let's wake her up a little later.
ah.
good morning.
whaaat?!
it's already this late!?
huh? but
i set it right yesterday.
is it broken...?
it sounded really loud.
i really didn't notice...
well, then.
i think i'll ask you to clean the fallen leaves.
leave it to me!
good morning, sir.
oh, are you here to help?
yep! are you shopping, grandma?
you're doing well...
if you'd like, come by.
welcome, sir.
welcome, sir.
welcome, sir.
this is...
do you think it's going to attract customers?
let me clean up when there's a lot of people around...
come back again sometime!
a few days later
manager!
yes. yes.
manager, you like sweets, right?
granny asked the manager to have some, too!
i'm so sorry...
oh yeah, since mel came, we have a little more customers
really?!
are you helping me!?
of course, sir.
thank goodness...
thank goodness!!
i'll do my best from now on!
manager! is this my apron!?
yeah, i tried making some last night.
wow! there's even a frog with it!
i guess that's what makes me look like a clerk.
i need you to do some shopping today.
here's your money and notes.
i put a little more money in.
mel, why don't you go buy something for yourself?
tenchooo...
hahaha. i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome back.
ugh... sorry for asking too much of you...
i'm fine!
i bought you a souvenir.
heheh.
let's eat together later.
oh, and...
i want the manager to stay healthy forever.
it's a charm.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
thank you, sir.
by the way...
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for eating together, isn't it?
hahaha.
let's go shopping for mel next.
yeah!
............
is your hand cold?
i'm fine!
i can't wait to go shopping with the manager.
yeah, you're right.
anyway, i have to buy mel's clothes.
yeah!
you know what?
i like my clothes bigger!
if it's bigger, you can wear it even if you're taller, right?
i... i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
um...
the peeling of the vegetables...
peeler?
that's it, that's it!
i'm not good with knives, though.
peeler can peel the skin.
then help me with the cooking more.
i'll be more useful to the manager!!
manager!?
are you going to sting the onions?
oh yeah, onions...
i had a stomachache, and i went to the pharmacy
thanks, man.
i think it'll look good on the manager.
your choice?
this boy who was hired by fate
he lost his job and a place to live in the fire.
and the only thing i had in my backpack
that's all you got?
lann.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
but she still smiled and worked every day.
i'm happy to do a lot of shopping today
manager!
look, look!
it's a frog hat!
it's nice and warm.
why don't you try it on?
heheh.
yeah, yeah, it looks good on you.
like a frog.
cool?!
eh!?
ah... yeah, that's right.
what do you mean by cool...?
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
this is good, isn't it?
it's gonna get cold. you need a coat, don't you?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
is it okay for me to wear something this formal...?
what the hell are you talking about?
it's cold if you're not careful, right?
the lining was also a quilt.
oh, and...
is this good, too?
...it's a little girly, don't you think?
really? it's convenient to be able to wear it easily
you'll be fine if you grow taller.
you're right, it's amazing.
or a sweater to keep you warm...
can i wear it now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry, sir.
let's go to the cookware shop next!
maitenchou
you want a peeler, right?
yeah. yeah.
since we're here, why don't we buy mel's tea bowl?
go find him, okay?
yeah!
!!
disposal...?
it's a frog figurine.
do you want it?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
but... but...
buying it won't help anything, you know?
i'm sure he didn't need it, so he stayed.
is that so?
i thought i wanted one.
the frog figurine is a good omen.
maybe we should hang it in the store.
hey, manager.
the frog was depressed earlier.
you look kind of happy now.
yeah, you're right.
maybe he's just happy to have a place to belong.
yeah. yeah.
it's just like me.
same?
yeah, the same.
ohhh...
you look happy...
leave peeling the manager to me!
yeah, nice to meet you.
i'll buy a peeler that's easy to peel...
should i practice cutting with a kitchen knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll teach you, so why don't you give it a try?
well, then...
............
tenchoo...
i don't think i can do this...
i'm losing my fingers...
...the cat's hand first.
a cat?
holding down the vegetables to hide her nails...

yeah!
i'm sharing it with the umbrella manager!
yeah, i'm good.
i see. that's good.

funeral house
people are not equal.
but...
”death” comes to everyone equally.
all right, then.
say goodbye to the deceased.
no, no, no, no.
no way.
i didn't expect you to come this far.
ah!
that's mama from the bar on 1chome!
she's the proprietor of my favorite store!
i'm still very popular!
it'll liven you up!
funeral home?
to create a space between the living and the dead.
i can't take this anymore.
and i'm one of them.
he's dead, isn't he?
welcome to the phantom funeral parlor.
it's a human being that can see.
huh?
your late sister's makeup?
president of karasuma funeral society, karasuma cardinal, age 25.
yes. yes.
funeral client, sakurano sparrow, age 19.
angel makeup.
that's what you said, right?
i know it's unreasonable.
but no matter what, i...
i wanted to put makeup on oneechan...
huh?
i'm not a pro yet, but...
it's a makeup egg from a vocational school!
i can do it properly! karasumaru
i don't think you should.
huh? !
i've never met a living girl
you must have had a beautiful face.
<unk>why?<unk>"
mr. sparrow
i heard your sister was a famous beauty actress.
there's a media circus going on every day.
i'm not...
are you saying you're not good enough to do your sister's makeup?
haha, that's not what i meant.
your face after your sister's accident.
did you see that?
i'm sure you're right.
uh... no.
from the hospital.
he told me i shouldn't look so much...
the current sakurano swallow
it's not the face you know.
car accident.
a frontal collision to a guardrail caused by overspeed.
his face was torn to shreds by a broken windshield.
broken bones have pierced through the skin.
it's a simple procedure at the hospital
you wouldn't recognize your older sister when she was alive.
after i saw your face, i said, i can't do it.
then it's troubling.
.........i...
what do you think?
but even so
are you prepared to face your current sister?
mr. funeral!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
could you not tease the sparrow too much?!
she's my little sister!
swallow
you asked me to do it.
of course it is!
i don't want her to see me like that!
i'm used to being hated by others.
but i don't want my sister to get mad at me.
i guess that's how it is...
don't make suzume do her makeup.
hey, what's up?
but why don't you consider suzume's feelings?
it's just the two of us.
...to you.
what do you know?!
anyway!
i won't accept it!!
i need another agent!
and...
and?
...it's nothing!!
...anyone would.
goodbyes full of regrets
it's lonely, right?
welcome!
car accident death of a beautiful actress, sakurano swallow.
there are a lot of rumors going around in the world
what do you think, sir?
there are rumours that someone killed him.
she was one of the weirdest people in the entertainment industry.
what does that mean?
well, like a pillow... or a rookie pickle.
it's just a rumor.
to be honest, you're not very nice either, are you?
his face and acting skills are certain, but
inside... huh?
after that, we'll continue.
the truth of sakurano swallow's death.
ah!
<unk>i was watching<unk>"
sparrow!
take this to table four!
sorry to keep you waiting!
here you go.
...wait.
huh?
funeral home?
doumo
the ramen was delicious.
isn't it?
it's our pride and joy!
you go to vocational school while earning your own money.
it takes money to go to school! i can't take a day off!
i don't want to burden onee-chan as much as possible...
............
oh, um...
huh? !
shall we go?
eh?
where!?
where your sister is now.
is this...?
ghosts.
we know where he is.
the first is where he died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and the third
beside the person you care about.
that's what i'm saying.
i'm actually here.
oneesan.
heheh.
is the undertaker joking?
please call me kururu.
mr. cardinal...
hah.
don't you think badly of your sister?
there's a lot of rumors going around...
rumors are rumours, right?
you can ask him for the truth.
the cardinal is interesting.
...me, too.
i was on the plane until a few minutes ago.
my sister's car was in an accident.
on the way home from work
the forecast says it's going to rain heavily after the cloudy weather.
i'm busy with work, too.
he said, it's my birthday, so let's go eat somewhere.
he came to pick me up.
but i got into a fight with oneechan.
it's about the school fees.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but, um...
i didn't ask you to pay for everything.
when my parents died
to oneechan, who became my parent
i didn't want to cause you any more trouble...
you're still a child.
that's what he said.
pissed me off.
hey! sparrow!
i jumped out of the car.
i hate you so much!
oneechan...
that's what it is.
those were the last words i said to my sister.
oneechan's accident.
because you were driving too fast, right?
i think he was probably chasing me.
after i left the car
it's raining like crazy.
my dream is...
was to be in charge of oneechan's makeup on stage.
but, um...
it's not coming true anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
oneechan's dead.
until the end.
i caused you trouble, oneechan...
i don't care if it's a bother.
it's not something you can decide for yourself.
what about the truth?
swallow
did i bother you?
...?
「if i'd thought of it as a bother...」
”i won't be by your side.”
you know that better than anyone, don't you?
what do you mean by that?
...it's strange.
i saw oneechan just now.
mr. cardinal...
can i ask you to do it again?
if you're prepared to accept everything about oneechan
it's done.
hey. hey.
can i open my eyes now?
yeah!
today's makeup...
i'm confident!
...pfft.
ahaha!
you're terrible at this.
even though i did my best...
you still have a long way to go before you can become my personal makeup.
can i become one too?!
in charge of oneechan's makeup!
hey. hey.
life isn't that sweet.
when i can make makeup that satisfies me
i'll think about it.
when the time comes, i'll give you a reward.
really?!
so at best
brush up your skills!
swallow
it was beautiful.
...i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
she wasn't by your side either.
of course it is!
i didn't want the sparrow to see me like that.
you didn't intend to fulfill my request from the beginning.
it wasn't there.
if it's your real request
i made it come true.
huh...?
<unk>susan<unk>"
thank you very much!
thanks to you
i can send you home without any regrets.
um..
this one.
the makeup brush i borrowed
i'll give it back to you.
huh? !
that's...
this belongs to you, sparrow.
huh?
...onee-chan.
but...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
the swallow.
i'm sure he was going to give it to you for dinner.
they found him outside the car.
as a memento of my sister.
even in the face of accidents
this one was miraculously intact.
i'm sure of it.
your sister protected you.
...i'm not going to thank you.
you're so stubborn.
you're indebted to me.
hi, hi, hi.
...why would you do that?
isn't it exhausting?
you're doing this kind of work?
i see someone crying every day.
i don't know how you can say condolences to a stranger.
that's not true.
you are...
you can smile, can't you?
it's really...
meddlesome funeral parlor.
...thanks.
the sound of civilization and enlightenment
when the curtains of darkness are paid
evil furies never cease to exist.
no.
the light of man covers the world.
the demon's delusion, the source of the evil, will prevail in this world.
kureha
it's...
...as you wish.
to do that
we are fury hunters.
fury hunters and punitives
arifuji hiroya
i'll go for it.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
kuchitaka mitsuki
it seems that zaito did it alone again
the devil's tamaki floating around.
what a grudge.
he must have been a very powerful demon.
but, you know
as expected of a fury hunter from the great onmyouji family.
i can't believe that giant demon was burned to a crisp.
the strength of a demon.
if you tell him you're a demon, he'll kill you.
ever since the demon devoured my family
she's a real demonic hater.
but it's not necessarily a mistake.
that eye.
there's definitely a demon nesting in his heart.
if there is a demon nesting in your heart...
that's--
no, no, no! stop!
it must have been that day.
let go of the chords!!
nii...
sir...
no, no, no...
please, don't...
huh? ah...
oh, my god.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
how dare you?
how dare you...
my father...
my mother...
a chord...!!
i don't think that's necessary.
visiting a grave like this.
kureha
an offering like that...
every time i kill a demon
to lay my fingers on the grave...!!
............
it's for my family.
look in front of the grave covered in tamagi.
is this an offering...!?
do you think your parents and your sister will be at peace!?
kureha
i thank you for being able to serve the head of the fujiwara clan for generations as a shikigami.
but i don't know.
the revenge memorial service i swore to my wounded family.
you can't stop him.
i don't know the ache in my wounds.
not you.
tell me...
even i...
i hate evil demons.
for not being able to protect you that day when you were caught off guard.
i'm still burning with frustration.
but i don't know.
but more than that, i'm worried.
hiroya
your eyes are clouded.
hey, hiroya--
message!
message!
what's going on?
demon attack in progress!
requesting immediate backup!!
roger that.
we're on our way.
huh? what's that?
nao-sho-
target identified as a demon who attacked the capital ten years ago.
target kigooooo
kakyoumaru
round...
the kaleidoscope... the hand mirror...
ah, hiroya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's the best i can do.
let's go, kureha!
tonight, i will fulfill my wish.
you're like a demon.
*flap*
that's ridiculous.
an elite punitive force of one or two...
that's the end of it...?
y-youuuu...
you monster!!
it's been a while since i came to the imperial capital
i don't know what to say. i don't know what to say.
you can eat as much as you want.
higuh
huh? what?
leftovers?
hii!
the humans in this area
i ate most of it.
your family's in my belly.
you don't like me?
hate. hate. hate.
hatred is what entertains me the most.
- ta-ta.
help me...
hmph.
it's no fun.
who the hell are you?!
fury hunters and punitives
arifuji hiroya
i've waited ten years to avenge my family.
i'll send you to hell.
kagamimaru!
arifuji...?
you.
that arifuji!?
the boy i ate ten years ago...
it almost tasted good.
i'm so happy i can't stop drooling.
arifuji...
kureha
goi
gwoh!
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
goyo's 'kyokuen' (the ultimate flame) worn to bury you
that pain won't go away easily.
these wounds from ten years ago.
until this ache subsides.
enjoy it to your heart's content!!
hiroya, you're too excited. calm down.
the enemy is a cunning demon who caught me and your father off guard ten years ago.
be careful--
every day!?
don't worry about it.
ten years of anger.
it's not gonna be that easy.
kah...
<unk>hahaha<unk>"
*ka-ka-ka*
well done, sir.
i'm glad you're here.
i grew hatred.
it was worth the spit back then.
i've never seen hatred so mature before.
it's the best food in the world.
arifuji...
i want to eat you in the best possible way.
hmph.
that wish.
you will never get what you want!
if that's the case
what do you think of this?
brother...
my sister... with genjutsu!
hiroya!!
bullshit.
to that kind of delusion
my sword will not be dulled now.
even though it's a genjutsu, my sister's face...
what a terrible will...!
but...
she didn't hesitate at all?!
kihii
kihihi.
good job, zaifuji.
it's the best!!
your delusion.
this looks the best!!
this is not a delusion!
this is justice!
it's justice to my family!!
how do you talk about family love?
there's someone who can cut your sister to pieces.
zaifuji
look at that.
just look at me.
your delusion.
i want everything out of you.
huh?
oh, huh?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
hiroya
what's going on!?
this is...
shoki is being sucked into an old wound!?
i killed arifuji.
i want to eat it in the best way possible.
bastard...
are you trying to turn hiroya into a demon!?
the kaleidoscope!
passion takes over the most when people are swallowed up by it.
hiroya, listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the delusion of vengeance dominates you--
you will become a demon and become one with me, arifuji!!
hang in there, hiroya!
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
that's right, come on.
it's the next one.
in the next swing...
delusion.
i'll eat you!!
aaaaaaaaaaah!
ugh...
ah..!
give it to me.
yes, sir.
oh, um...
oh, my god.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
it's no fun.
the shikigami is struggling.
you risked your life to distract him from me.
well, whatever...
now get down.
rasetsugari
the curse i put on you ten years ago.
it's not that easy to take.
chikami
hahakami
the chords...
what's the matter, sir?
wearing a demon mask...
take that thing.
hurry up and face me.
o...ni...
y-you're...
i'll... kill you!
aaaaaaaah!?
s-stop it!
yes, sir.
hana,
se...
no, no, no, no...
swallowed in.
here.
the...
you fool!!
gah... ah!?
he's fallen for some stupid curse.
he's still the heir to the zaitou family!?
that's ridiculous.
why are you cut down...?!
it's...
haha.
why? that's a strange question.
-!?
the lord is in danger.
i can't sleep with just a single stroke.
open the wound.
burned it!?
it's time to see it.
oh, my...
a little bit of patience, though.
g-g-g-g-give me...
you're starting to come to your senses.
bastard...
shikigami?
how dare you stand in the way of the kaleidoscope!
i can't do this all by myself.
a hundred years?
don't get carried away after a hundred years, kagamimaru.
i've been a shikigami for a thousand years since the peaceful world.
even if i'm inferior to you in strength
this love...
i won't lose to delusions.
delusion covers all feelings.
don't let it swallow you.
look at me. look at me.
feel me.
remember your family with the smell on your body.
don't forget your dreams.
the feelings in your heart.
and then...
that i'm always there for you.
this is bullshit...
i won't forgive you.
such a farce.
huh?!
kakyoumaru
i'm sorry, but...
from here on out
you're alone in sumo.
sorry, kureha.
wounds... they hurt.
don't prove it.
i don't train so softly that i can't stand here.
if you say so--
come on, man.
h-hey, wait, wait.
what do you think you're doing?
no way--
goi
stooooop.
ugh...
ohhhhhh!!
uh... yeah.
the curse...
sakaiki
my obsession burns...
what a waste.
it's such a waste.
what a waste, what a waste...
damn youuuuuuuuuuuu!!
the greatest hatred, the greatest resentment.
the ultimate delusion.
taste of what you've wasted.
tokuto
savour it!!
taste of delusion.
i already know.
forgetting about pain and getting drunk on hatred.
it was certainly sweet, kakyomaru.
but i don't know.
we're done.
i've had enough of this.
i will never lose sight of my feelings.
kureha
...what's that?
heavy.
you don't have anything to say, do you?!
what do you mean, missing? the burn on my arm hurts, and i'm exhausted.
at least turn me into spirit form...
hmph.
this is your punishment.
punishment for pointing your blade at me.
i'll take you to your house.
i'm gonna have to sit on my ass for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
he put on airs when he killed kagamimaru.
i don't know when i'll lose sight of myself again and hurt you.
i can't take it anymore.
i don't have the right to deal with you.
idiot.
i'm well aware of the boy's weakness.
you may stray from the path on moonless nights.
that's what i'm here for.
he served arifuji from the time of peace.
hayachinen
a thousand years of love
it's your trial!
i see...
i can't take this.
now, let's see.
okay, i'm gonna clean the grave tomorrow!
h-hey!
don't run so fast!
