siola of the binding eye
kuchitaka mitsuki
that's why
i told you i don't know!
that's not a debt!
you say that, but...
renee...
i have a loan card over here.
we need to pay tortiano back for what he owed us.
i don't give a fuck!
i can't believe my father's debt to the casino...
excuse me.
are you from the tortiano family?
huh?
we're in the middle of something. come back!
uh, um...
please wait!
ah!
*cough*
you bastard...!
i'm sorry... i tripped because i couldn't see.
what do you want with the mafia?!
uh, uh...
my name is shiola, and i'm working as a sink gunman.
i heard the name of the tortilla family that runs this area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard...
his closed eyes...
gunman...?
oh, um...
don't underestimate the mafia.
ah!
close-eyed bodyguards?
do you wanna try dumping the brains that came from the gun at your waist?
huh?
u-um...
hey, stop it! in a place like this!
...
hm?
don't tell me you...
a woman?
yes, that's right, but...
hoh.
show me your face.
eh?
even with closed eyes, if you're good at what you do, you'll be able to...
no, wait...!
aaah!?
what the hell is this...
you bastard...
- what?
what the hell are you showing me!!
that's terrible!
are you all right?!
i'm going home today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
leene
are you stupid?
you're...
can you buy a gun arm from a tortilla family that's made up of shootings?
and then you pick a fight with bill tortilla.
he's one of the tortilla brothers, the roughest man in the city.
i see.
that big guy, about seven feet tall, was the younger brother of the mafia brothers...
that's right!
i won't say anything bad, so get out of the city...
hm? that's about the height of the building.
how can you tell exactly when you can't see...?
you can roughly tell by the direction the voice is coming from and the weight of the footsteps.
you weigh a little more than five or seven feet, three sizes...
wha?
do you really know that much?!
i'm joking.
...this ain't gonna happen.
haha.
well, i think it's about time.
we need to find a place to stay tonight.
ow!
...
ah, geez.
here's your reward for getting rid of me.
i'll do something about that filthy outfit first.
memoto
if you don't want to be seen, wrap a towel around it.
th-thank you very much!
i'll wash you.
you don't know what to do with a shower at someone's house.
um...
you're quite used to using closed eyes.
yeah...
my father had bad eyes, too.
no...
well, it got worse, to be precise.
he's a terrible father... a pathetic painter.
he only drew naked women for money and sold them wholesale to tortillas.
but he got sick and his eyes got worse and worse.
he must have been shocked in his own way.
you lost your job, you lost your money, and you got burned.
he's trying to model me.
after that, he gambled, got into debt, and got into a river dobon.
you're a terrible father, aren't you?
...in the end...
are you a model, mr. lene?
...yeah.
it's because he was persistent.
i wouldn't have made much money if i had, but...
that's right...
that's good to hear...
you must have been very happy.
i was able to draw your daughter before she was blind.
mr. lene?
i-it's nothing.
your back is done.
come on. look at me.
more importantly, what about you?
why are you traveling with a gun?
and those eyes...
it's not a big deal.
he shot and killed the mafia that killed his parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown for that crime.
these eyes
and then, as proof of his sins...
...
did she crush my eyes...?
oh, my god, that's terrible.
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing terrible about it, miss rene.
it's not as tragic as a fragment of your father.
i wished for my own blood, you idiot.
i can't complain about what he's done to me.
why don't you drop your gun?!
even if that's what happened!!
but...
in that case...
throw it away?
i've had enough of this.
we only have guns and closed eyes.
i'll go get dinner ready.
call me if you need anything.
i'm sure he's lying...
it's the kind of lie that beggars make to attract attention.
of course it is...
!
a-are you done yet?
i just did it, too.
show me to my seat now.
-!!
renee, i just got out.
okay, kaori.
it smells like hamburg steak.
huh?
renee!
damn it!
let go of me!
what's this all of a sudden?!
don't shout like that, renee.
i think my brother told you a lot of things.
but that doesn't mean you have to go this far.
don tortiya!!
good grief.
can't you do something about that manly personality?
oh, well.
and now you've got a buyer.
a buyer...?
i like you a lot better when you buy your father's paintings.
he wanted to buy you as a model.
good evening, rene.
if the buyer arrives in a few hours, the debt will be settled.
of course
i don't know how they're going to treat the shipment.
heh.
don't fuck with me!
s-someone!!
yes, sir.
it's futile, rene.
no one's gonna come yelling in a warehouse on the outskirts of town.
oh, my god.
you idiots can't complain no matter what they do to you.
if your father hadn't suffered from an eye injury, he would have kept you alive.
h-hey...
what do you mean...
we won't be seeing each other again, so i'll tell you.
your father was in trouble because his eyes were bad.
i told him i'd buy him the next painting for extra money.
i'm sure you'd be worried if it were just a verbal agreement, so i prepared a contract for you.
it's just that i was careless.
i messed up the paper a little.
don't tell me you didn't even notice him because his eyes were bad.
the contract that i signed
i didn't know it was such a big loan.
wait a minute... then dad...
what's the value of a painter who lost his eyesight?
i felt sorry for you, so i sent you to the afterlife!
she's probably drawing an angel nudity by now!!
huh?
tee-hee!
the window was higher than i thought...
hey...
what's with this guy?
siora?!
no, no, no.
excuse me for calling so late...
i want you to take care of mr. renee.
i came to pick you up, but...
ah, bro!
this is the strange closed eye i reported earlier!
what is it, bill?
were you followed?
even if i tried to poke him...
he's got eyes.
it's the smell.
the delicious smell of the hamburg steak that mr. leen made.
i followed it all the way here...
it smells like boiled meat.
i don't feel so good.
at this rate, dinner will get cold.
we didn't pull out our guns.
please let me go home peacefully.
......
bill.
oh, yeah.
because idiots who can't see the situation at all
i'll have to use lead bullets to teach them a lesson.
you're the one who licked my closed eyes.
siora!!
fuck you.
the one who shot him...
that's first.
bil!?
damn it, get ready.
don't let him get away!!
kill him!!
...!? i can't hit him!!
what's going on?!
don't pull the trigger so roughly.
i know exactly where they're coming from.
uoooh!!
hii!
damn you!
don't close your eyes!!
binding eyes!!
binding eyes...?
don't tell me...
i've heard of it...
there was a gunman who killed a city mafia for revenge...
people in the city feared his power.
i burned his eyes, stitched his eyelids, and drove him out of the city.
that poor gunman...
even now, they're shooting villains like ghosts...
is it this guy...?
binding eye shooter
don't tell me this kid...
oh, my god.
which one of you can't see?
close your eyes and take it lightly.
you idiots.
this guy, the light...
stay still, okay?
mr. leene.
i'm done here.
it's the darkness of closed eyes.
*sigh*
*sigh*
*sigh*
*sigh*
i'm alive...
but...
am i the only one?
are you hurt?
mr. leene.
yeah. yeah.
damn it!
my...
my family...
how did this happen?
why...?
don't fuck with me...
then why?
dad's dead!!
w-wait!
don't shoot me.
die!
die!!
why are you...
why?!
siora!!
this is my father...
mr. leene.
if you pull the trigger
make sure you're prepared.
damn it...
i-i'm saved!
shiola, i mean.
i heard you want to hire me.
now, with your price...
did you just say why?
and he said, why?
it's funny.
i can't believe you're not prepared for that.
outrageous and lower
it's not like i've ever done this before.
damn you.
hmph.
in the darkness.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
didn't i tell you it was okay?
you didn't have to go out of your way to see me off.
you should at least thank him.
i did it on my own.
you're going to keep shooting people?
yeah, well...
by my eyes.
......
it's quite a load to see you off.
yeah. yeah.
i'm leaving town, too.
it's depressing to be here.
that's...
where the hell are you going...?
where are you going?
you're happy, aren't you?
no, you can't do that.
i feel like i'm alive with blood.
if you're with someone like me...
the cheap sympathy is...
don't get the wrong idea.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't think i can pull your hand.
you're allowed to make another meal for your benefactor, aren't you?
but...
i knew it.
we're both lonely.
going down the street alone
come on, man.
there's a train coming.
dream wings
it's made of wax.
the higher you fly
it's going to melt into the sun.
- in that case...
it's better not to fly in the first place.
one day, for sure.
this is a failure!!
the manned rocket, asagao, exploded!
because you're going to fall to the ground.
japan's first manned spaceflight failed!!
balloon dream
kuchitaka mitsuki
ten years later summer
aikawa hitoshi
you have the academic ability to aim for a top university.
so why are you aiming for a recommendation from a thirdclass university?
i really don't have any dreams.
a dream...? what a waste.
if there is an easy and safe path, you should choose it.
am i wrong?
that's great, aikawa...
for someone as cute as you.
it's easy to ask for things.
- what?
for you, during summer vacation
you're going to help out with my astronomy club.
- what?
hey! hey!
why are you helping out with a club that has nothing to do with it?
well, listen to me.
i know you like to cross the stone bridge
the world doesn't go into tiger holes, and you don't get tigers.
that's what the teacher wants to teach you.
so while you're at the hot spring, please take care of the astronomy club.
i'm just going on a trip!!
damn it!
why would i do this?
if you don't help, i won't recommend you.
isn't that a threat?!
...the astronomy club.
it's here.
excuse me!
hm?
whaaaaat?!
wh-what is this?!
...a balloon?
i'm sorry. it's a mess right now.
are you by any chance a helper?
welcome!
to an astronomy club full of dreams full of balloons!
let's do this again!
i'm captain mizuki sonoyama!
i heard from the teacher. you're aikawasan, right?
i look forward to working with you.
no, no, no.
same here!?
what's with this guy?
is there no one else in the club?!
i'd like to get down to business.
go home!
ta-dah!!
balloons.
we're going to lift the camera up into space!!
you got a camera?
balloons.
i saw it on tv before!
fluffy and the camera went into space on a balloon...
the balloon broke, and the parachute came crashing down...
if i retrieve the camera, i can take pictures of the earth!
see? aren't you excited?
wha?
that blockheaded teacher who helped out a little!!
what a pain in the ass you are pushing onto me...!!
- what?
and...
that's why there are so many balloons!
aikawasan, please fill it up too!
hey, hey.
no matter how many balloons you collect, there's no way they'll float!!
*munch*
he's an idiot.
............?
what are you so stunned about!?
if you don't put helium in, the balloon won't float!!
why are you using disposable cameras anyway?!
ah!
it was so cheap...
are you going to roll a film in space and snap the shutter?!
geez.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there's plenty of pictures of the earth on the internet.
you don't have to take pictures yourself...
yeah. yeah.
well, that's...
my dream.
because i'm going to be an astronaut and look at the round earth.
this is the first step to a dream.
that's why i really want to take pictures of myself.
that's the only way to talk about your dreams.
only those who've never had a dream come true.
if you're aiming to be an astronaut, you know.
ten years ago...
japan's first manned rocket, asagao, failed to launch.
you don't get much out of it, and you just put people on a rocket
risk and cost jumps.
a lot of people suffered because they failed.
manned spaceflight?
don't think about the consequences. it's stupid.
i'm so sorry.
i didn't mean to...
it's all right.
but to me
it's an important dream.
i-i can't help...
i'll help you out.
recommend...
because i have to take it.
awesome!!
the camera is really flying!!
i can't believe i'm able to take pictures of the earth now...!!
no, no, no. i can't take pictures.
i told you it's just a test shoot today.
huh? really?!
listen to what i have to say!
it's hard to just jump high out of nowhere.
i need to get a feel for it first...
the real battle is using a huge balloon that can withstand the decrease in atmospheric pressure to reach the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters.
i'm sure the air currents will wash away a lot of it.
i'll turn on the gps and go look for him at the drop point.
this time, in a little while, pull the octopus strings and retrieve it.
oh ... i see
......
aikawa-san.
hm?
help
i mean, really.
thank you very much.
......
i had no choice but to do it because of the recommendation...!!
huh?
it's just...
it's a strange feeling...
oh, dear.
this is...
the thread must have been cut...
there's nothing we can do about this...
what should i do?
i have to go after him.
no, it's okay. it's fine.
it's a 2,000 yen toy camera.
and around here, you're just gonna fall into the mountains or the fields.
it's more expensive to find.
no, i can't.
because it's important to...
something important to me...
you...
did you get something?
i'm sorry! i want to go into space no matter what!
it's so light...
but i'm sure he'll object.
of course i do!
i'm calculating the weight!
you can do that on your own...!!
aikawa-san...
i...
i'll go look for him.
i've been listening for a while.
you're always so flustered.
i can't go out with you!!
this balloon woman!!
after work, he's always going to look for him...
it's really...
you idiot.
......
what kind of dream is that?
i'm home.
welcome back, dad!
jin
you're still awake?
because dad hasn't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
really? well, it can't be helped.
asagao is
because it's your father's dream.
i collapsed from mental stress, and then...
i know you're in charge of the development of the rocket, but you've taken the brunt of all the blame...
i didn't think you'd trip over the first launch in japan.
that's the worst possible outcome.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i wish i hadn't done it.
huh...?
aikawa-san?
you still have some left?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
ehehe
today, too...
i couldn't find it.
- what?
hey, hey!!
you...
it's really hot!
don't look for me until i'm like this!
why did i do something so pointless...?!!
anyway, let's go to the infirmary...
......
no, it's not.
it's not pointless...
hey, hey!
because...
my...
my...
it's a dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry, sir.
aikawa-san.
i'm gonna throw up.
upupu
w-wait, sonoyamaaaa!!
huh?!
i'm on my way home from a trip, so i want to take it easy!
you're my advisor, so at least give me a car!!
geez.
for now, let's secure the footing to the point of impact.
let's get ready for the launch!
hey, you're so low-spirited!!
i was bedridden from a cold, and before i knew it, the day of the launch
in the end, we didn't find the prototype...
no matter what.
there was something in there that i wanted to give to the universe...
hey! hey!
come on, look up.
this is it, right?
what's important to you is...
it was sold ten years ago.
asagao's limited keychain
i've been wondering.
i don't know what you're so obsessed with.
that's why i was looking for you while you were asleep.
don't tell me you're taking pictures of the earth
i can't believe you're trying to hold a memorial service for the rocket.
ahhhh, kawa-shan...
see?
i'll put it on you, so hurry up and get ready!
for me, too.
it's important.
...one thing.
let me hear it.
if you have that key ring...
you were watching too, right?
where the asagao falls
how can you be so calm?
i can say i want to be an astronaut.
asagao, which was the dream of many people
it was made of wax, and it was the wings of a egg.
you'd be worried if you saw something like that.
if you fail, you'll lose everything.
it's scary, isn't it?
like setbacks.
regret?
my wings...
i don't know what to do if it's fake.
i don't think so.
fake wings.
if you can't fly
what really hurts when the wings are broken
i'm sure of it.
because it's a real wing.
that pain is proof that he was struggling.
that's why i...
i don't regret it.
i won't even die.
there it is...
there it is!!
i wonder if it really went up into space.
wh-what the hell?!
are you doubting me?
no! that's not it...
well, that's...
you'll know when you see what's inside.
tsk. the earth was blue.
that's what it feels like...
yes, sir.
haha...
hahahaha, hahaha!
whaaat?!
did i say something strange?!
no, i'm sorry.
it can't be true.
i didn't think i'd be able to take a picture with a balloon.
um...
aikawa-san.
hm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i'll play piggyback with you.
i'm just being selfish...
i'll even give you a treasure...!!
it's really...
it's okay. i don't mind.
i'm sure.
it's not a big deal.
why, compared to this view
i'm sure it's no big deal.
i'll stop recommending you.
i'll study harder to make it.
a rocket that even an idiot like you can go into space.
i'll do it.
i'll make you one.
hii!
what do you mean, stupid?!
hey, you!
you said it yourself, didn't you?
ugh...
i'm glad it's not my neighborhood.
excuse me...
come on in.
i-it's medicine...
she's really at her wit's end!!!
what's wrong?! does your stomach hurt?
ugh...
if you eat the rice balls you picked up...
onyaka...
eating, huh?
come on, i'll let you use the bathroom, so get some rest.
ojamasashi...
let's see...
a shop that used to live and work was destroyed by a fire.
he said he got lost in the streets and ate.
i'm sorry for the trouble.
no, no, no. that was a disaster.
feeling a little better?
yeah!
oh, that's right! i'll pay for the drink.
yeah, i don't need the money...
huh?
huh?!
i'm sorry...
uh...
...
do you want to work at my place if you don't have a choice?
are you sure?!
i wonder if i can prepare food and a place to sleep... if that's okay with you.
that's more than enough.
the manager saved my life.
you're exaggerating, hahaha...
what's your name?
it's mel!
where am i supposed to help from?!
ii!!
yeah. i'll be counting on you starting tomorrow.
yes, sir.
it's hot, so don't get burned.
*sigh* it's so good... so good...
i'm glad i had a stomach ache...
are you sure it's okay?
...well, i guess it's okay.
thank you very much!
i'll do my best to be useful.
uh, the alarm clock...
you like frogs?
yeah. yeah.
good night.
nwaaah!?
i see. an alarm clock...
what a terrible volume...
i'm surprised you can sleep with that sound...
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
...
maybe he was tired.
i'll wake you up a little later.
ah.
good morning.
huh?!
it's already this late?!
what? but...
i made sure to set it yesterday.
did it break...?
no, it was ringing loudly.
i really didn't notice...
well, then.
i think i'll ask you to clean the leaves.
leave it to me!
good morning.
oh my, are you helping?
are you shopping, granny?
you're doing well...
feel free to stop by.
come on in.
come on in.
come on in.
this is...
do you think it'll attract customers?
let me clean it when there's a lot of people around...
come again!
a few days later...
manager!
yes, sir.
manager, you like sweets, don't you?
grandma told the manager to have some too!
man, i'm so sorry...
oh yeah, we've had a little more customers since mel arrived.
really?!
i'm helping you!?
yes, of course.
thank goodness...
thank goodness!!
i'll do my best from now on!
manager! is this my apron?!
yeah, i made some last night.
amazing! there's a frog on it too!!
i wonder if this makes me look like an employee.
i need you to do some shopping today.
yes. money and notes.
i put a little extra money in there.
you should buy something for yourself, too, mel.
tenchooo...
hahaha. i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome back.
i'm sorry i asked too much...
it's okay!
i bought you a souvenir.
*giggle*
let's eat together later.
and, uh...
i want the manager to stay healthy forever.
it's a charm.
it's not like i've ever done this before.
thank you, sir.
by the way...
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for eating together, isn't it?
hahaha!
next time, let's go buy something for mel.
yeah!
...
aren't your hands cold?
it's okay!
i'm looking forward to going shopping with the manager.
yeah, you're right.
anyway, i need to buy mel's clothes.
yeah!
you know...
i want bigger clothes!
if it's big, you can wear it even if you're tall, right?
i-i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
um...
peeling vegetables, um...
pealer?
that's right, that's it!
i'm not good at using knives.
if you have a peeler, you can peel it.
then help me cook more.
i'll be more useful to the manager!!
manager!?
are you going to sting onions?
oh, yeah, the onion...
i broke my stomach and went to the pharmacy
thanks. thank you.
i think it'd look good on the manager.
your choice?
this boy who was hired for a reason.
he lost his job and a place to live in the fire.
and the contents of his only backpack.
that's all your stuff?
ran.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
even so, he worked with a smile every day.
i'm happy to buy a lot today.
manager!
look at this!
it's a frog hat!
isn't it nice that it looks warm?
why don't you try it on?
*giggle*
yeah, it looks good on you.
like a frog.
is it cool?!
huh?!
ah... yeah, you're right.
what do you mean, cool?
oh, that's right.
this is good, isn't it?
you need a coat because it gets cold, don't you?
it's not like i've ever done this before.
is it really okay for me to wear something this proper...?
what are you talking about?
it's cold, isn't it?
the lining's warm, too.
and...
isn't this good, too?
...doesn't that sound a little girly?
really? it's convenient to put it on right away.
with this, it's okay to grow taller.
you're right. that's amazing.
there's also a sweater to keep from getting cold...
can i not wear it now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry, sir.
let's go to the cooking tool shop next!
hatenchou
uh, you want a peeler, right?
yeah. yeah.
since we're here, why don't we buy mel's bowl?
go look for him, okay?
yeah!
!!
disposable...?
oh, it's a frog figurine.
do you want it?
it's not like i've ever done this before.
but...
buying it won't help anything, you know?
i'm sure he stayed because he didn't need it.
is that so?
i thought i wanted it.
frog ornaments are a good omen.
maybe it's a good idea to hang it in the store.
hey, manager.
mr. frog was dejected earlier
you look happy right now.
yeah, you're right.
maybe he's just happy to have a place to belong.
yeah. yeah.
same as me.
same?
yeah, the same.
ohhh...
she looks so happy...
manager, leave the peeling to me!
yeah. nice to meet you.
let's buy some easy peeling vegetables from the peeler...
do you want to practice cutting with a knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll tell you. why don't you try it first?
then...
...
tenchoo...
i don't think i can do it...
i'm gonna lose my finger...
first, the cat's hand.
nekote?
holding down the vegetables to hide her nails...
yeah, yeah, yeah.
the knife is gripped like a knife from above.
put the blade in your left hand.
i cut it as if to push it in.
...i'm starting to think i can do it...
yeah, yeah, that's it.
itadakimasu
...
the vegetables are so big.
it's good to eat each other's food.
really?!
oh, it's really good...
it's way better than my food...
i'm...
manager's food.
i think it's delicious every day!
ah.
thank you, sir.
sekaiichi!!
that's too much!!
hahaha.
*giggle*
it's so warm.
yeah, you're right.
ah!
.........huh?
tenchou
are you all right?
i'm glad mel didn't get hurt.
be careful.
i'm sorry...
if you use a chair, you can reach high places.
i'll do my best!
yeah, make sure you don't fall.
i wanna get bigger...
good luck locking up the shop.
yeah, leave it to me!
...training? are you going to be late?
yeah, it's past 9 o'clock.
you can eat dinner and go to sleep first.
all right, all right.
i'll be going now.
have a good day!
...
it's kind of cold...
snow...?
it's getting late...
it's later than i thought.
mel, you should eat dinner...
meh...!?
did you come to pick me up?!
i brought the manager's umbrella.
*sniff*
thank you, sir.
i'm worried, so please wait at home next time.
yeah...
mmhmm. what about your umbrella?
ah.
i have a hat.
you must have forgotten...
come on.
don't get out of the umbrella.
yeah. yeah.
...isn't it cramped?
not at all.
...
i guess there's something nice about being small.
i always thought i was losing.
did something happen?
yeah!
i'm half in love with the umbrella manager!
yeah. yeah.
...i see. that's good.
aren't you cold?
yeah. yeah.
manager's with me.
funeral parlor
people are not equal.
but...
death comes to everyone equally.
well, then.
i bid the dead farewell.
no, no, no.
oh, my god.
i didn't think you'd come this far.
ah!
that's mama from the first street snack bar!
over there is the proprietress of my favorite shop!
i'm still very popular!
it's going to be lively!
funeralists are
the work of creating a place for the living and the dead.
...geez.
i'm one of them.
he's dead, isn't he?
welcome, phantom undertaker.
he's a man who can see.
huh?
your late sister's makeup?
karasuma funeral company president: karsuma kururu, 25 years old
yes...
suzume sakurano, 19 years old.
angel makeup
isn't that right?
i know it's impossible.
but no matter what i do
i want to do makeup for my sister...
huh?
i'm not a professional yet, but...
it's a makeup egg that goes to a vocational school!
you can do it, karasuma-san!
you shouldn't do that.
!
i've never met a living girlfriend
it must have been a beautiful face.
why?!
suzume-san.
i heard your sister was a famous beautiful actress.
the media is making a fuss every day.
...not me.
are you saying you're not good enough to do your sister's makeup?
haha, that's not it.
your sister's face after the accident
did you see that?
that's probably true.
no, no, no.
from the hospital.
i was told not to look too much...
right now, sakurano swallowsan
it's not the face you know.
car accident
and it's a frontal collision with the guardrail caused by overspeed.
his face was torn to shreds by a broken windshield.
broken bones are breaking through the skin.
it's a simple procedure at the hospital
no one will notice you when you're alive.
when i looked at your face, i said, i can't do it.
so it's a problem.
......i...
what do you think?
even so...
are you prepared to face your sister now?
hey, funeral parlor!
it's not like i've ever done this before.
don't bully suzume too much!
she's my sister!
mr. swallow.
you were the one who asked me to do this.
of course it is!
i don't want to be seen by that horrible face of hers!
i'm used to other people hating me!
but i don't want my sister to fall for me.
i guess that's how it is...
don't make suzume do her makeup.
wait, what?
but why don't you think about suzumesan's feelings?
we're just a family of two.
...to you.
what do you know?!
anyway!
i won't accept it!!
you're gonna have to fill in another one!
and...
and?
...it's nothing!!
...anyone.
a farewell full of regrets.
it's lonely, isn't it?
have a good day!
sakurano swallow, a beautiful actress, died in a traffic accident.
the world is full of rumors
what do you all think?
there are rumors that someone killed him.
she was one of the weirdest people in the entertainment industry.
what do you mean?
well, i guess you could call it a pillow... or a rookie pickle.
it's just a rumor.
to be honest, your likeability isn't good either, is it?
your face and acting skills are certain
what's inside...?
- we'll keep going.
the truth of sakurano tsubamesan's death
ah!
i was watching you.
suzumechan!
take this to table four!
sorry to keep you waiting!
yes, sir.
...wait.
huh?
funeralist?
doumo
the ramen was delicious.
right?
it's our pride and joy!
you go to a vocational school while earning your own money.
i need money to go to school! i can't take a day off!
i'll do my best not to burden my sister...
...
ah...
!
let's go.
eh?
where are you?!
where is your sister now?
this is...
ghosts.
i know where he is.
the first is where he died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and the third thing is
beside the person you love.
you know what?
i'm actually here.
your sister.
heheh.
are funeral parlors joking, too?
please call me kururu.
kurusan...
ha.
don't you think badly of your sister?
there are all kinds of rumors...
rumors are rumors, aren't they?
you just have to ask him the truth.
kurusan, you're so funny.
...me too.
i was in the car until just a little while ago.
in my sister's car that caused the accident.
on the way home from work
after the forecast clouded over, it rained heavily...
even i'm busy with work.
it's my birthday, so let's go somewhere to eat.
he came to pick me up.
but i got into a fight with oneechan.
...about the tuition.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but...
i didn't hear oneechan was going to pay for everything.
my parents died.
to oneechan, who acted as my parent
i didn't want to cause you any more trouble...
you're still just a kid.
that's what he said.
it pisses me off.
hey! suzume!
i ran out of the car.
i hate you!
oneechan, you...
that's what it is.
those were the last words i said to my sister.
oneechan's accident
wasn't it because of too much speed?
i think he was probably chasing me.
after i left the car and ran
because it's raining so hard.
...my dream...
i was in charge of oneechan's makeup on stage.
but...
it's not coming true anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
oneechan's dead.
until the end.
i caused you trouble, oneechan.
...i don't know if it's a bother or not.
it's not something you can decide for yourself.
in fact, how is it?
swallow.
did i bother you?
...?
「if you think it's a bother...」
「i won't be by your side.」
「you, my sister, know better than anyone, don't you?」
that's what he said.
...it's strange.
i saw oneechan for a moment.
kurusan...
can i ask you to do it again?
if you're prepared to accept everything
it's done.
hey! hey!
can i open my eyes now?
yeah!
today's makeup...
i'm sure of it!
...pfft.
ahaha!
shimote
...i tried so hard...
there's still a long way to go before you can become my personal makeup.
can i be one too!?
oneechan's in charge of makeup!
hey! hey!
life isn't so sweet.
if you can make makeup that will satisfy me
i'll think about it.
when the time comes, i'll give you a reward.
really?!
that's why, at best
sharpen your arm!
swallow.
that was beautiful.
......i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
suzumesan wasn't there, either.
of course it is!
i didn't want suzume to see me like that.
you never intended to fulfill my request from the start.
it wasn't there.
if it's your real request
i made it come true.
huh...?
kuru-san!
thank you very much!
thanks to you.
i can send oneechan without regrets.
um...
this is it.
i borrowed your makeup brush.
i'll return the favor.
!
that's...
this is yours, suzumesan.
- what?
onee-chan...
gah...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
mr. swallow
i'm sure he was going to give it to you when we were having dinner together.
he was found outside the car.
i kept it here as a keepsake of your sister.
of all the accidents
this one was miraculously unharmed.
i'm sure.
your sister was protecting you.
......i'm not going to thank you.
you're pretty stubborn yourself.
you're a big help to me!
yes, yes, yes.
......why?
aren't you tired?
you do this kind of work?
day after day, i see someone's crying face
i don't even know how to express my condolences.
...i don't think so.
you are...
you can smile, right?
...really.
you're such a busy undertaker.
...thanks.
the sound of civilization and enlightenment
when the curtains of the night are cleared
there's no end to the demonic furies.
no.
to the extent that human light covers the world.
delusion, the source of evil, spreads throughout the world.
kureha
...
...okay.
that's why
we fury hunters
fury hunters
arifuji hiroya
i'm going to recommend it.
it's not like i've ever done this before.
kuchitaka mitsuki
it seems that zaito did it alone again.
an evil spirit floating around.
what a grudge.
you must have been a very powerful demon.
but it's not the same.
as expected of the fury hunter from the daiinyōji family.
i can't believe that giant demon was burned to the ground.
he's as strong as a demon god.
hey, if you tell him you're a demon, he'll kill you.
ever since my family was devoured by demons
he's a real demon hater.
but it's not a mistake.
that eye.
there's definitely a demon nesting in his heart.
if there's an ogre in your heart...
well, that's...
s-stop it!
it must be that day.
let go of the chord!!
nii...
s-sir...
don't...
please, don't...
ah...
aaah...
aaaaaaaaaahhhh!
how dare you?
how dare you...
my father...
mother...
a chord...!!
let's not do this.
this kind of grave visit
kureha?
such an offering...
every time i kill an evil demon
to offer a finger to the grave...!!
...
it's for my family.
look in front of the grave that's full of energy.
this is what i'm supposed to do...!
do you think your parents and sister will be at ease?!
kureha
i am grateful to you for being able to serve the head of the zaito family as a shikigami for generations.
but...
i swore to this kind of wound and my dead family that i would pay my respects for the revenge.
you can't stop me.
you don't know the ache in your wounds.
you don't.
you'll tell me...
even i...
i hate demons.
that day, i was caught off guard and couldn't protect you.
even now, i feel like i'm burning with frustration.
but...
more than that, i'm worried.
hiroya
your eyes are clouded.
hey, hiroya!
message!
message!
what's wrong with you?
the demon attack is spreading!
requesting immediate support!!
roger that.
we're on our way.
ugh...
nao nao!
the target was identified as a demon who attacked the capital ten years ago.
target oni-go
kakyoumaru
maru...
kaleidoscope... brush mirror...
ah, hiroya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's the real deal.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i will fulfill my wish.
he's like a demon.
bah!
impossible...
there's only one or two elite subjugators left...
you're saying they were wiped out...?
y-you little...
you monster!!
it's been a while since i came to the capital.
it's like it's not chewing.
isn't this all you can eat?
*hic*
oh?
the remnants of the devourer?
hii!
the people in this area
i devoured most of them.
your family is in my belly.
do you hate me?
hate, hate, hate.
hatred is what makes me the most fun.
- ta-ta.
help me...
hmph.
it's funny.
what the fuck!?
fury hunters
arifuji hiroya
i've been waiting for ten years. avenge my family.
i'll send you to hell.
kagamimaru!!
arifuji...?
you...
that arifuji!!
the boy who ate ten years ago
i thought it tasted pretty good.
i'm so happy i can't stop drooling.
zaitou...
kureha
goi
gwoh!
oooooooohhh!?
goyo's goku homura, which i wore to bury you.
that pain won't go away easily.
these scars carved ten years ago.
until this ache subsides
taste it to your heart's content!!
hiroya, you're too excited. calm down a little.
your opponent is a cunning evil that took us by surprise ten years ago.
be careful!
11-1-1!?
don't worry about it.
ten years' anger
it's not that easy.
ugh...
*crunch*
*crunch*
well done...
i'm glad you're here.
he raised hatred.
at the time, it was worth spitting on him.
i've never felt such mature hatred before.
it's just the best ingredients.
arifuji...
i want to eat you in the best way possible.
hmph.
that wish.
know that it will never come true!
in that case...
how about this?
brother...
i'll use genjutsu to kill my sister... this is bad!
hiroya!!
gekiga
that's the kind of bafflement
at this point, my blade will not dull.
even though it's a genjutsu, my sister's face...
a tremendous will...!
but...
don't hesitate like this!?
kihii
kihihi
that's good, arifuji.
this is the best!!
your obsession.
it looks really good!!
this is not a delusion!
this is justice!
it's justice to my family!!
which words do you use to talk about family love?
someone who can carve her sister's figure up to this point.
arifuji
look at that.
just look at me.
your obsession.
expose everything to me.
ugh.
oh...
ooooooooohhh!!
hiroya
what the hell's going on?!
this is...
shoki is being sucked into an old wound!?
i'll take care of arifuji.
i want to eat it in the best way possible.
damn you...
are you going to make hiroya fall into a demon?!
kagamimaru!!
passion takes the most heat when a person is consumed by it.
listen to me, hiroya!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the delusion of revenge dominates you...
you will become a demon and become one with me, arifuji!!
hang in there, hiroya!
ooooooooohhh!!
that's right. come here.
it's the next one.
with the next strike...
it's delusional.
i'll eat you!!
aaaaah!
ugh...
ah!
give it to me.
hah...
ah...
ahhh!
aaaaahhhh!!
it's funny.
the shikigami is struggling.
you risked your life to distract your master from me.
oh, well...
get out of here.
fury hunting
the curse i put on you ten years ago.
it's not that easy to take.
father.
hahakami
the chords...
what's wrong with you?
put on a demon mask.
give me something like that.
hurry up and show your face...
o...ni...
y-you're...
oni... i'll kill you!
whaaaat!?
s-stop it!
hah...
let's see,
se...
i can't...
swallowed!
i-i-i...
no
fool!!
gah ... ah!?
i fell for a stupid curse.
he's still the heir to the zaito family?!
impossible.
why are you the one who was cut?!
...
haha.
why? ask him something strange.
- !?
to the danger of the lord.
can you sleep with just a sword?
the wound.
burned?!
you've got to notice.
well...
i've had a little bit of patience.
g-give me...
he's starting to come back to his senses.
damn you...
like a shikigami.
i won't stand in the way of kagamimaru, who's lived a hundred years!!
even on my own, i've done this much.
a hundred years?
don't get carried away in a hundred years, kagamimaru.
i've been a shikigami since the time of peace.
even if i'm inferior to you in strength
this love
i won't lose to a delusion.
a delusion covers all feelings.
don't let something like that swallow you.
look at me.
feel me.
the smell carved into your body reminds you of your family.
don't forget the dream.
the feelings that were in your heart
and...
that i'm always by your side.
it's stupid...
i won't forgive you.
such a farce.
- !?
kakyoumaru
i'm sorry, but...
from here on out
you're alone in a sumo match.
i'm sorry, kureha.
wounds... does it hurt?
don't prove it.
i don't train so softly that i can't stand here.
well, if you say so.
i beg you.
h-hey, wait, wait.
what are you going to do?
no way!
goi
nooooooo!
ugh...
oaaaah!!
yeah...
the curse...
sakaiki
my obsession burns...
what a waste.
what a waste, what a waste.
what a waste, what a waste...
damn iiiiiiiiiit!!
a grudge that will never end.
the ultimate delusion.
the taste of what you've wasted.
tokuto
taste it!
if it's the taste of delusion
i already know.
forget the pain and get drunk on hate.
it was sweet, kagamimaru.
but...
i'm done with this.
i don't know what to do anymore.
i won't lose sight of my feelings.
kureha
...what is it?
it's heavy.
you're saying that because you don't have anything to say?!
there's nothing missing. the burns on my arm hurt, and i'm exhausted.
at least turn me into a spirit...
hmph.
this is punishment.
punishment for pointing a blade at me.
i'll take you home like this.
i'll have to put it on my butt for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
when he killed kagamimaru, he put on a show.
i don't know when i'll lose myself again and hurt you.
i don't know what to do anymore.
i don't have the right to handle you.
tawake
at this point, i'm aware of the boy's weakness.
on a moonless night, you may stray from the path.
that's why i'm here.
he served arifuji from the heian period.
hayachinen
chitose's feelings
it's your inquisition!
i see...
i can't do this.
now, let's see...
okay, tomorrow we're gonna clean the graves!
h-hey!
don't run so fast!
