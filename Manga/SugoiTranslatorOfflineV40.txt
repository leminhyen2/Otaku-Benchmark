siora the binding eye
kuchitaka mitsuki
that's why...
i told you, i don't know!
i don't owe you that much!
you say that, but...
rene...
there's a loan agreement over here.
you'll have to pay back the money you borrowed from tortiano.
how am i supposed to know?!
the debt his father owed at the casino...
excuse me.
are you from the tortiano family?
huh?
we're in the middle of something. come back later!
huh? u-um...
please wait!
ah!
gah!
damn you...!
i'm sorry... i tripped over my blind eye.
what business do you have with the mafia with closed eyes?!
u-umm...
my name is shiola, and i'm the gunman for the sink.
i heard the name of the tortiya family that ran the whole area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard...
the blind closed eyes...
gunman...?
oh...
don't underestimate the mafia.
ah!
close-eyed is a bodyguard?
do you want to blow out the brains that came from the gun at your hip?
huh?
u-um...
hey, stop it! in a place like this!
...
hm?
could it be that you...
a woman?
yes, that's right, but...
hoo.
show me your face.
huh?
even with closed eyes, as long as you're good at it, you'll be able to do the trade...
hey, wait...!
-?!
what the hell is this...?
you bastard...
?
what the hell are you showing me?!
wow, that's terrible!
are you all right?!
i'm going home today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
rene
are you stupid?
you...
can you buy a gun arm for the tortiya family, which is made up of shooting each other?
and in the end, to pick a fight with bill tortilla
he's one of the tortiya brothers, the roughest man in the city.
i see. i see.
that seven-foot-tall giant was the mafia brothers' younger brother...
that's right!
i won't say anything bad, so hurry up and get out of town...
...hm? sure, that's about the height of the building.
how do you know exactly when you can't see...?
i can more or less tell by the direction of the voice and the weight of the footsteps.
you weigh a little more than five or seven feet, three sizes...
wha?!
you don't know that much?!
i'm just kidding.
...it's not stiff.
haha!
well, it's time for me to get going.
we need to find an inn for tonight...
ow!
...
ah, geez.
it's my way of thanking you for getting rid of me.
i'll do something about that dingy outfit first.
memoto
if you don't want to be seen, wrap a towel around it.
th-thank you very much!
i'll wash you.
you don't know what to do in a shower at someone's house.
...um...
you're quite used to dealing with closed eyes, aren't you?
yeah...
my father had bad eyesight, too.
no...
to be precise, it was getting worse.
he's a terrible father... he's a humble painter.
he only drew naked women for money and sold them wholesale to tortillas.
but my eyes are getting worse and worse because i'm sick.
she must have been shocked in her own way as a painter
with less work, less money, and more grilling, i guess.
they're trying to model me.
in the end, he took a gamble to cover up his debt and dobban in the river.
he's a terrible father, isn't he?
...in the end.
are you a model, lene?
...yeah.
he was so persistent.
it wouldn't have been much money to draw me, but...
i see...
that's good to hear...
you must have been very happy.
i was able to draw your daughter before she was blind.
lene?
i-it's nothing.
my back is done.
come on, look this way.
more importantly, what about you?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even those eyes...
it's no big deal.
he shot and killed the mafia that killed his parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown for that crime.
this eye
at that time, as proof of my sins...
...
you could say my eyes were crushed...?
how terrible...
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing terrible about it, ms. rene.
it's not as tragic as a fragment of your father.
i wished for my own blood, inhuman.
someone like that can't complain about what they've done to her.
why aren't you throwing away your gun?!
even if it's something like that!!
but...
in that case...
throw it away?
to me, it's already...
there's nothing but guns and closed eyes.
i'll go get dinner ready.
call me if you need anything.
i'm sure it's a lie...
it's the kind of lie a beggar would make to attract attention.
of course it is...
!
a-are you done already?
i just finished this one, too.
show me to my seat now!
-!!
renee, i just got out!
oh, listen to me, kaori.
it smells like hamburg steak.
huh?
renee!
damn it!
let go of me!
what's this all of a sudden?!
don't yell like that, rene.
i think my brother told you a lot of things.
but that doesn't mean you have to go this far.
don tortiya!!
oh, come on.
can't you do something about that manly personality?
well, whatever.
and now you've got a buyer.
a buyer...?
i'm much more interested in you when you buy your father's paintings.
he would love to buy you as a model.
welcome, rene.
if the buyer arrives in a few hours, the debt will be settled.
then again,
i don't know how it'll be handled at the shipping site.
heh.
don't screw with me!
s-someone!!
yes, sir.
it's useless, rene.
shouting in a warehouse on the outskirts of town won't get anyone here.
seriously.
i can't complain no matter what you do to me, idiot.
if your father hadn't suffered from an eye disease, he would have kept you alive.
wha...
what do you mean...
i don't think we'll ever meet again, so i'll tell you.
your father had a bad eye and was in trouble.
i said i'd buy you the next picture for a high price to add to the cost of your treatment.
i'm sure you'd be uneasy with just a verbal agreement, so i also prepared a contract for you.
it's just that i was careless.
i messed up the paper a little.
don't tell me you didn't even notice him when his eyes were bad.
the contract i signed.
i can't believe it was a huge loan.
wait... then my dad...
what's a painter who lost his eyesight worth?
i felt sorry for him, so i sent him to the afterlife!
she's probably drawing an angel nude right about now!!
huh?
tee-hee!
the window was higher than i expected...
hey...
what's with this guy?
siora?!
no, no, no.
sorry to bother you so late at night...
i'll take care of lene here.
i came to pick you up, but...
ah, bro!
this is the strange closed eye i reported earlier!
what is it, bill?
were you followed?
even if i tried to poke her...
he's got eyes...
it's the smell.
the delicious aroma of the hamburg steak that rene made
i followed it all the way here...
it was filled with a stench like boiled rotten meat
i don't feel very well.
at this rate, the dinner we went out of our way to have would be cold
neither of us drew our guns.
could you please let me go home peacefully?
......
bill.
oh, yeah.
stupid idiots who can't see the situation at all
i'll have to teach him a lesson with lead bullets.
you're like a closed eye licking me.
siora!!
go to hell.
i shot him.
that comes first.
bil!?
damn it, get ready.
don't let them get away!!
kill him!!
...!? i can't hit it!!
what the hell's going on?!
don't pull the trigger so roughly.
i know exactly where it's coming from.
whoa!!
hii!
this guy!
don't close your eyes!!
it's a binding eye!!
binding eyes...?
don't tell me...
i've heard of it...
there was a gunman who killed all the mafia in a city out of revenge...
people in the city feared his power.
i burned his eyes, stitched his eyelids, and drove him out of the city.
that poor gunman...
they say he's still shooting villains like a ghost...
is it this guy...?
binding eye shooter
don't tell me this kid...
seriously.
which one of you can't see?
close your eyes and underestimate them.
you idiots.
he's got a light...
please stay still.
mr. lene.
i'm done here.
it's the darkness of closed eyes.
hah.
hah.
hah.
hah.
i-i'm alive...
but...
just me?
are you hurt?
mr. lene.
yeah. yeah.
damn it!
my...
my family.
how did this happen?
why...?
don't screw with me...
then why?
dad's dead!!
w-wait a minute.
don't shoot me.
die!
die!!
why...
why?!
siora!!
this is my dad...
mr. lene.
if you pull the trigger
make sure you are prepared.
damn it...
i-i'm saved.
shiola, was it?
you want me to hire you?
now, at your price...
did you just say why?
and he said, why?
it's funny.
i can't believe you're not prepared for that.
outrageous or lower.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
damn it, man.
hmph.
in the darkness.
repent for the rest of your life.
didn't i tell you it was okay?
you went out of your way to see me off.
you should at least thank him.
i did it on my own.
you're going to keep shooting people?
yes...
by my eyes.
......
it's quite a load to see you off.
yeah. yeah.
i'm leaving town, too.
it's depressing to be here.
that's...
where the hell are we going...?
where you're going
you're happy, aren't you?
no, you can't do that.
it's like i'm living in a bloodbath.
if you're with someone like me...
the cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't think i can pull your hand.
you're allowed to make food again, aren't you?
but...
i knew it.
we're both lonely.
going down the road alone
i don't know...
the train's leaving.
the wings of dreams
it's solidified with wax.
the higher you fly
i'm going to melt into the sun.
- in that case...
better not fly in the first place.
someday, for sure.
it's a failure!!
the manned rocket, asagao, exploded!
because you're going to fall to the ground.
japan's first manned spaceflight failed!!
balloon dream
kuchitaka mitsuki
ten years later――summer
aikawa hitoshi
you have the academic ability to aim for a top university.
so why are you after a recommendation from a third-rate university?
i really don't have a dream.
a dream...? that's stupid.
if there's an easy, safe path, you should choose that one.
am i wrong?
that's great, aikawa...
not for a cute student like you.
easy to ask for a lot of things.
?
for you, during summer vacation
i'll have you help out with my astronomy club.
?
hey! hey!
why are you helping out at a club that has nothing to do with it?
well, listen.
i know you like to hit the stone bridge and cross it
if you don't go into tiger holes, you won't get torako.
that's what the teacher wants to teach you.
so while you're at the hot springs, take care of the astronomy club.
i just want to travel!!
damn it!
why would i do something like this?
if you don't help, i won't recommend you.
that's a threat, isn't it?!
...the astronomy club.
it's here.
excuse me!
hm?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?
wh-what the hell is this?!
...a balloon?
i'm sorry. it's a mess now.
oh, are you helping out by any chance?
welcome!
to the astronomy club full of balloons and dreams!
allow me to introduce myself!
i'm the president, mizuki sonoyama!
i heard from the teacher. you're aikawasan, right?
i look forward to working with you this time.
no, no, no, no.
same here!?
what's with this guy?
there aren't any other members?!
i'd like to get down to business right away.
go home!
ta-daaa!!
with balloons.
get the camera up into space!!
a camera?
with balloons.
i saw it on tv before!
fluffy and camera went into space on a balloon...
the balloon broke, and the parachute fell...
if we retrieve the camera, we'll be able to take pictures of the earth!
right? aren't you really excited?
wha?!
what kind of help is that blockheaded teacher?!
what a pain in the ass you've been pushing onto me...!!
?
and...
that's why there are so many balloons!
aikawasan, please make it swell up a lot too!
hey, you know...
but no matter how many balloons you collect, there's no way they'll float!!
*munch*
he's definitely an idiot.
.........?
what are you so shocked about?!
if you don't put helium in there, the balloon won't float!!
why a disposable camera in the first place?!
ah!
it was so cheap...
are you going to roll a film in space and snap the shutter?!
goddamn it.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there's plenty of pictures of the earth on the internet.
you don't have to take pictures yourself...
yeah. yeah.
well, you see...
my dream.
because i'm going to be an astronaut and look at the round earth.
this is the first step towards my dream.
that's why i really want to take pictures of myself.
the only one who can talk about dreams like that
only those who have never seen the end of a dream.
if you're aiming to be an astronaut, you know.
ten years ago――
japan's first manned rocket, asagao, failed to launch
there wasn't much in return, but just putting people on a rocket
the risk and the cost jump up.
a lot of people suffered because they failed.
manned spaceflight?
that's what idiots do when they don't think about the consequences.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to say this...
it's okay. it's okay.
even so, to me
it's an important dream.
i-i can't help you...
i'll help you out.
recommended...
i have to take it.
wow~~~!!
the camera is really flying!!
i can't believe i can take pictures of earth now...!!
no, no, i can't take a picture.
i told you today was just a test shoot.
huh? really?!
listen to what i have to say!
flying high all of a sudden would be a high hurdle, after all.
i need to get a feel for it first...
the main event is the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters using a huge balloon that can withstand the decrease in atmospheric pressure.
i'm sure the air currents will wash away most of it.
i'll turn on the gps and go look for the drop point.
this time, pull the octopus thread a little more and retrieve it.
oh... i see.
......
aikawa-san.
hm?
help out.
really.
thank you very much.
......
i had no choice but to go for the recommendation...!!
huh?
for some reason...
it's a strange feeling...
ouch!
this is...
i guess the thread's broken...
there's nothing we can do about this...
what should i do?
i have to go after him...
no, it's fine. not really.
it's a 2,000 yen toy camera.
and around here, you'll just fall into the mountains or the fields.
it's more expensive to find.
i-i can't do that.
because it's important to me...
what's important to me...
...you...
did you get something on your own?
i'm sorry! i really want to go into space!
it's so light...
but i'm sure they'll object!
of course it is!
i'm doing a proper weight calculation here!
you did that on your own...!!
aikawa-san...
i'm...
i'll go look for her.
i've been listening for a while now.
you're always talking about the fluffballs.
i can't go out with you!!
you balloon girl!!
she's always looking for me after work...
really...
you idiot.
......
what's a dream?
i'm home.
welcome back, dad!
jin
you're still awake?
because dad hasn't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
really? well, it can't be helped.
asagao is
it's your father's dream, after all.
she collapsed from mental stress and stayed like that...
i know you're in charge of the development of the rocket, but you took the brunt of all the criticism...
i can't believe i tripped over my first launch in japan.
that's the worst possible outcome.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i wish i hadn't.
huh...?
aikawasan?
you still have some left?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
ehehe
another day...
i couldn't find it.
?
hey, hey!!
you...
you've got a really bad fever!
don't look for me until i'm like this!
why is it so pointless...?!!
for now, let's go to the infirmary...
......
no, that's not it.
it's not a waste...
hey, hey!
because...
my―――
my...
because it's a dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry.
aikawa-san.
i'm gonna throw up.
upuu
w-wait, sonoyamaaaaaaaa!!
huh?!
i'm on my way home from a trip, so i wanna take it easy!
you're my advisor, so at least give me a car!!
goddamn it.
for now, i'll make sure we get to the drop point.
let's get ready for the launch!
hey, you're so low-spirited!!
ugh... i was bedridden with a cold, and before i knew it, it was the day of the party.
in the end, we didn't find a prototype...
no matter what.
there was something in there i wanted to put up in space...
ora.
raise your head.
this is it, right?
the important thing you put in...
it was sold ten years ago.
asagao's limited keychain
i was curious.
i don't know why you're so fixated on it.
that's why i was looking for you while you were asleep.
don't tell me that while i'm taking pictures of the earth
i can't believe you're trying to hold a memorial service for the rocket.
aaaaaaaaaa aikawashan...
come on!
i'll put it on, so let's get ready!
for me, too...
it's important to me.
...one thing.
let's hear it.
if you have that keychain, that means...
you were watching, too.
where 'asagao' falls.
how can you be so calm?
you can say you want to be an astronaut.
asagao, the dream of all kinds of people
it was a wax-hardened egg wing.
seeing that would make you uneasy.
if i fail, i'll lose everything.
it's scary, isn't it?
like a setback.
like regrets.
my own wings.
what if it was a fake?
i don't have one.
fake wings.
when i couldn't fly
what really hurts when your wings are broken
i'm sure that's it.
because it's a real wing.
that pain is proof that you were struggling.
that's why i...
i don't regret it.
i won't even die.
there it is...
there it is!!
i wonder if it really went up into space.
wh-what the hell?!
are you doubting me?
no! that's not what i meant...
well, that's...
you'll find out when you check what's inside.
tch. the earth was blue.
that's what it feels like...
yes, sir.
haha...
hahahahahahahahahahaha!
whaaat?!
did i say something strange?!
no, i'm sorry.
no way, really.
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
excuse me!
aikawa-san.
hm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i'll carry you on my back.
i'm just being selfish...
i'll even give you a treasure...!!
really...
it's okay. it's okay.
i'm sure
it's no big deal.
why, compared to this scenery
i'm sure it's no big deal.
i'll stop recommending you.
i'll study and make more for you.
a rocket that even an idiot like you can go into space.
i'll do it.
i'll make it for you.
hii!
what do you mean, idiots?!
you!
didn't you just say it yourself?
wow...
i'm glad it's not my neighborhood.
excuse me...
come on in.
i-it's medicine...
she's at her wit's end!!!
what's wrong?! does your stomach hurt?
ugh...
i picked up a rice ball... and ate it.
onyaka...
food, huh?
here, i'll lend you the bathroom, so go rest, okay?
sorry to disturb you...
let's see...
the shop i used to live and work at was destroyed by a fire
he said he got lost on the street and ate.
i'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.
no, no, it was a disaster.
feel a little better now?
yeah!
oh, that's right! i'll pay for the drinks.
yeah, i don't need the money...
huh?
huh?!
i don't have any money...
uh...
...
if you don't have a place to work, why don't you work at my place?
are you sure?!
i wonder if i can prepare food and a place to sleep... if that's okay with you.
that's more than enough.
you saved my life, manager.
you're exaggerating, hahaha...
what's your name?
it's mel!
i don't know where to start!!
ii!!
yeah. i'll be counting on you tomorrow.
yes, sir.
it's hot, so don't get burned.
ugh... delicious... delicious...
i'm glad i had a stomachache...
are you okay with that?
...well, i guess it was okay.
thank you for the meal!
i'll do my best to be useful.
um, an alarm clock...
you like frogs?
yeah. yeah.
good night.
nuaah?!
i see. an alarm clock...
what a vicious volume...
i'm surprised you can sleep with this sound...
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
...
maybe he was tired.
i'll wake you up a little later.
ah.
good morning.
huh?!
it's already this late!?
huh? but...
i set it up properly yesterday.
did it break...?
no, it was ringing loudly.
i really didn't notice...
okay, then.
maybe i should ask you to clean the fallen leaves.
leave it to me!
good morning, sir.
oh my, are you helping out?
yeah! are you shopping, grandma?
you seem to be doing well...
if you'd like, you can stop by.
come on in.
come on in.
come on in.
this is...
does it look like it'll attract customers?
let me clean it up when there's a lot of people...
come again!
a few days later...
manager!
yes, sir.
manager, you like sweets, don't you?
grandma told the manager to have some, too!
man, sorry about that...
oh yeah, we've had a little more customers since mel arrived.
really?!
am i being useful to you?!
of course.
thank goodness...
thank goodness!!
i'll do my best from now on!
manager! is this my apron?!
yeah, i tried making some last night.
amazing! there's a frog on it too!!
i wonder if this makes me look like a clerk.
i'd like you to do some shopping today.
here's your money and notes.
i put a little extra money in there.
mel, go buy something for yourself, okay?
tenchooo...
hahaha, i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome back.
well... i guess i asked too much. sorry...
i'm fine!
i bought you a souvenir.
hehe.
let's eat together later.
oh, and also...
i want the manager to be healthy forever.
it's a charm.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
thank you very much.
...by the way.
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for eating together, isn't it?
hahaha!
let's go buy something for mel next.
yeah!
...
aren't your hands cold?
i'm fine!
i'm looking forward to going shopping with the manager.
yeah, you're right.
i'll have to buy mel's clothes first.
yeah!
you know...
i want bigger clothes!
if it's big, you can wear it even if you're taller, right?
i-i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
um...
that peeling vegetable...
peeler?
yeah, that's it!
i'm not good at using knives, though.
if you have a peeler, you can peel it.
then help me cook more.
i'll be more useful to the manager!!
manager?!
are you going to sting the onions?
oh, yeah, the onions...
i had a stomach ache and went to an apothecary
thank you.
i think it'd look good on the manager.
your choice, eh?
this boy who was hired for his own reasons.
he seemed to have lost his job and a place to live in the fire
the contents of yuichi's rucksack, too.
that's all your stuff?
ran.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
still, she worked with a smile on her face every day
i'm happy to buy a lot today.
manager!
look at this!
it's a frog hat!
isn't it nice that it looks warm?
why don't you try it on?
hehe.
yeah, yeah, it looks good on you.
like a frog?
cool?!
huh?!
ah... yeah, you're right.
what do you mean by cool...?
oh yeah, that's right.
isn't this good?
it'll be cold, so you need a coat, don't you?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
is it really okay to wear such proper clothes...?
what are you talking about?
it's cold if you don't do it properly, isn't it?
the lining's warm too.
and...
isn't this good, too?
...doesn't that sound a little girly?
really? it's convenient to wear it right away.
with this, i'll be fine even if i get taller.
you're right. wow.
there's also a sweater to keep from getting cold...
maybe i shouldn't wear it now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry.
next, let's go to the cooking store!
hattenchou
um, you want a peeler, right?
yeah. yeah.
why don't we buy mel's bowl while we're at it?
go look for him, okay?
yeah!
!!
disposable...?
oh, it's a frog figurine.
do you want it?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
...but...
buying it won't do you any good, you know?
i'm sure he stayed because he didn't need it.
is that so?
i thought i wanted it, though.
frog figurines have good luck.
maybe it's a good idea to hang it in the store.
hey, manager.
frog-san looked dejected earlier
you look kind of happy right now.
yeah, you're right.
maybe she's happy to have a place to belong.
yeah. yeah.
it's just like me.
the same?
yeah, the same thing.
ohhh...
she looks happy...
manager, leave peeling to me!
yeah, nice to meet you.
let's buy some vegetables that are easy to peel with peelers...
do you want to practice cutting with a knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll tell you, so why don't you give it a try?
then...
...
tenchoo...
i don't feel like i can do it...
my fingers are gone...
let's start with the cat's hand.
nekote?
holding down the vegetables to hide her nails...
yeah, yeah, yeah.
the knife gripped the blade from above as if grasping it
the blade rested on his left hand
i cut it as if to push it in deeper
...i'm starting to feel like i can...
yeah, yeah, keep it up.
itadakimasu
...
the vegetables are so big.
it's good to eat each other's food.
really?!
oh, it's really good...
it's way better than my food...
i...
manager's food.
i think it's delicious every day!
ah.
thank you very much.
sekaiichi!!
that much!!
hahaha
hehe.
it's warm.
yeah, you're right.
ah!
...huh?
tencho
are you all right?
i'm glad mel didn't get hurt.
be careful.
i'm sorry...
if you use a chair, you can reach higher places.
i'll do my best!
yeah, make sure you don't fall.
i want to get bigger...
then lock up the shop for me.
yeah, leave it to me!
...training? are you going to be late?
that's right. it's past nine.
you can eat dinner and go to sleep first.
okay. okay.
i'm off.
have a good day!
...
it's kind of cold...
snow...?
it's already this late...
it was later than i expected.
mel, make sure you eat dinner...
meh...!?
did you come to pick me up?!
i brought the manager's umbrella.
*sniff*
thank you very much.
i'm worried, so wait at home next time.
yeah...
hm? where's mel's umbrella?
ah.
i have a hat.
you must have forgotten...
come on.
make sure you don't stick out of the umbrella.
yeah. yeah.
...isn't it cramped?
not at all.
...
i guess there are some good things about being small.
i always thought i was losing out.
did something happen?
yeah!
i'm half sharing it with the umbrella manager!
yeah. yeah.
...i see. that's good.
aren't you cold?
yeah. yeah.
the manager's with me.
funeral parlor
people are not equal.
but...
death comes equally to everyone.
all right, then.
say your last farewells to the deceased.
no, no, no.
no way. no way.
i didn't think you'd come this far.
ah!
that's mama from the first street snack bar!
over there is the proprietress of my favorite shop!
i'm still very popular!
i'm going to live!
funeral houses are
a job to create a place for the living and the dead to die.
...geez.
i'm one of them.
he's dead, isn't he?
welcome, phantom undertaker.
i'm a person who can see.
huh?
the makeup of your late sister?
karasuma funeral company president: cardinal karasuma, 25 years old
yes...
funeral client suzume sakurano, 19 years old.
angel makeup
that's what they say, right?
i know it's unreasonable.
but no matter what, i...
i wanted to put on makeup for my sister...
*sigh*
i'm not a professional yet, but...
it's a makeup egg that goes to a vocational school!
i can do it! karasuma-san!
you'd better not.
!
i've never met a living girlfriend.
it must have been a beautiful face.
why!?
suzume-san.
i heard your sister was a famous beauty actress.
the media is making a fuss every day.
...i don't think so.
are you saying you're not skilled enough to do your sister's makeup?
haha, that's not what i meant.
your face after your sister's accident.
have you seen it?
that's probably true.
...no.
from the hospital.
i was told not to look too much...
right now, sakurano swallowsan
it's not the face you know.
car accident
it was also a head-on collision with the guardrail due to overspeed.
his face was torn to shreds by the broken windshield
his broken bones are breaking through his skin.
it's a simple procedure at the hospital.
i'm sure no one would notice you and your sister when you were alive.
after i saw your face, i said, i can't do it after all.
then it's a problem.
......i...
what do you think?
even so...
are you prepared to face your sister now?
hey, funeral parlor!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
can you not bully suzume too much?!
she's my sister!
...tsubame-san.
you asked me to do it, didn't you?
isn't that obvious?
i don't want suzume to see my face like that!
i'm used to other people hating me.
but i don't want my sister to back down.
i guess that's how it is...
don't make suzume do her makeup.
wait, wait.
but why don't you consider suzume-san's feelings?
it's just a family of two.
...to you.
what do you know?!
anyway!
i won't accept it!!
get me another agent!
and...
and?
...it's nothing!!
...anyone.
a farewell full of regrets
it's lonely, isn't it?
have a good day!
sakurano tsubame, a beautiful actress, died in a traffic accident.
there's a lot of rumors going around in the world
what do you all think?
there are rumors that someone killed him.
she was one of the weirdest people in the entertainment industry.
what do you mean?
well, i guess you could call it a pillow... or pickled rookies.
it's just a rumor.
to be honest, your affection points aren't good either, are they?
his face and acting skills are certain, though
what's inside, huh?
after that, keep going.
i was getting closer to the truth of sakurano tsubamesan's death
ah!
i was watching you.
suzume-chan!
take this to table four!
sorry to keep you waiting!
yes, sir!
...wait.
huh?
funeral shop?
doumo
the ramen was delicious.
isn't that right?
it's our pride and joy!
you go to a vocational school while earning your own money.
i need money to go to school, too! i can't take a day off!
try not to burden onee-chan as much as possible...
...
ah...
!
shall we go?
huh?
where are you?!
where your sister is right now.
this is...
ghosts.
we know where he is.
the first is where he died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and the third is
beside the person you care about.
that's what he said.
actually, i'm here.
big sister.
hehe.
are funeral parlors joking, too?
please call me kururu.
kuru-san...
ha.
don't you think badly of my sister?
there are a lot of rumors going around...
rumors are rumors, aren't they?
you can just ask him the truth.
kuru-san, you're so funny.
...me too.
i was on it until just a moment ago.
to my sister's car that caused the accident.
on the way home from work.
after the forecast was cloudy, it rained heavily...
even i'm busy with work.
it's my birthday, so let's go somewhere to eat.
he came to pick me up.
but i got into a fight with oneechan.
...about the tuition.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but...
i didn't hear big sis was going to pay for everything.
my parents died.
to my big sister, who took my place as my parent.
i didn't want to cause any more trouble...
you're still a child.
that's what he said.
it pissed me off.
hey! suzume!
i ran out of the car.
i hate you!
onee-chan...
that's what it is.
those were the last words i said to big sis.
onee-chan accident
wasn't it because you were going too fast?
i think he was probably chasing me.
after i left the car
because it started raining so hard.
...my dream...
i was supposed to be in charge of oneechan's makeup as she stood on stage.
but...
it won't come true anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
oneechan's dead.
until the end.
i caused you trouble, onee-chan...
...i don't care if it's a bother or not.
it's not something you can decide for yourself.
how is it actually going?
mr. swallow.
was that a bother?
...?
「if you think i'm bothering you...」
「i won't be by your side.」
「you, my little sister, understand better than anyone, don't you?」
that's what he said.
...it's strange.
i just saw onee-chan for a moment.
kuru-san...
can i ask you again?
if you're prepared to accept everything about oneechan
it's done.
hey~
can i open my eyes now?
yeah!
today's makeup...
i'm confident!
...bu.
ahaha!
i'm not good at this!
...i tried so hard.
it's still a long time before you can become my personal makeup.
can i become one too?!
i'm in charge of oneechan's makeup!
hey! hey!
life isn't that easy.
if you can do makeup that will satisfy me
you can think about it.
when the time comes, i'll reward you.
really?!
so, at best
sharpen your skills!
mr. swallow.
it was beautiful.
...i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
i wasn't by suzume-san's side.
of course it is!
i didn't want suzume to see my face like that.
you never intended to fulfill my request from the start.
it wasn't there.
if it's your real request
i made it come true.
huh...?
kuru-san!
thank you very much!
thanks to you
i can send my sister home without regrets.
um...
here you go.
i borrowed your makeup brush.
i'll return it to you.
!
that's...
this is yours, suzumesan.
?
...big sis.
but...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
mr. swallow
i'm sure he was going to give it to you when we had dinner together.
they found me outside the car.
i kept it here as a keepsake of your sister.
of all the accidents
this alone was miraculously unharmed.
i'm sure
your sister was protecting you, wasn't she?
...i'm not going to thank you.
you're pretty stubborn yourself.
it's a big deal for you.
hi, hi, hi.
......why?
isn't it tiring?
you do this kind of work?
day in and day out, i watch someone cry.
how dare you say condolences to someone you don't even know
...that's not true.
you...
you can smile, right?
...really.
you're a busy mortician.
...thanks.
the sound of civilization and enlightenment rang out
even if the curtain of the dark night is swept away
there is no end to the demonic furies.
no.
enough to cover the world with human lights.
delusions, the source of evil demons, spread throughout the world.
kureha
...
...your will.
to that end.
we fury hunters
fury hunter subjugator
arifuji hiroya
i'll go recommend it.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
kuchitaka mitsuki
it seems that zaito did it by himself again.
the demon's shouki drifting around the area.
what resentment.
he must have been a very powerful demon.
however...
as expected of a fury hunter from the great onmyouji family.
i can't believe that giant demon was burned to a crisp.
she's just as strong as a demon god.
hey, if you tell him you're a demon god, he'll kill you.
ever since my family was devoured by demons
i'm a real demon freak.
but it's not a mistake.
that eye.
there's definitely a demon nesting in his heart.
if a demon has nested in your heart...
that's--
s-stop it!
it must have been that day.
let go of the chords!!
nii...
sama...
stop it...
please, don't...
ah...
ahhh...
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
how dare you?
how dare you...
my father...
mother...
a chord...!!
why don't we stop?
such a grave visit.
kureha?
such an offering...
every time i slay a demon,
to offer your fingers to the grave...!!
...
it's for my family.
look in front of the shoki-covered grave.
so this is for her...!
do you think your parents and sister will feel at ease?!
kureha
i am grateful to you for being able to serve the head of the zaito family for generations as a shikigami.
but...
this kind of wound and the revenge memorial service i swore to my late family.
you can't stop me.
you don't know the ache of your wounds.
you can't do that.
she'll tell me...
even i...
i hate demons.
how i was caught off guard that day and couldn't protect you guys.
even now, i feel like my body is burning with frustration.
but...
i'm even more anxious than that.
hiroya
your eyes are clouding over
hey, hiroya!
message!
message!
what's wrong?
demon spawning damage is spreading!
requesting immediate support!!
understood.
i'll be there right away.
ugh...
nao-sama――
target identified as a demon who attacked the capital ten years ago.
target oni-go!
kakyoumaru
maru...
kaleidoscope... brush mirror...
oh, hiroya.
your eyes
it's like...
it's the real deal.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i will fulfill my long-cherished wish.
he's like a demon.
bah!
impossible...
one or two elite subjugators...
you're saying that was annihilated...?
y-youuuuu...
you monster!!
it's been a while since i've been to the capital
it's almost as if it's not chewy.
at this rate, you can eat as much as you want.
*hic*
oh?
what's left of the devourer?
hii!
the people in this area
i've devoured most of them.
your family is in my belly, too.
do you hate me?
hate, hate, hate.
hatred is what makes me the most enjoyable.
- ta-ta.
help me...
hmph.
it's time to wake up.
who the hell are you?!
fury hunter subjugator
arifuji hiroya
i've waited ten years to avenge my family.
i'll send you to hell.
kagamimaru!!
arifuji...?
you...
that zaitou!!
the boy i ate ten years ago
it looked pretty good.
i'm so happy i can't stop drooling.
zaito...
kureha
mii
guoh!
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?
kureha's 'ultimate flame' that i wore to bury you.
that pain won't go away easily.
these wounds carved into me ten years ago.
until this ache subsides.
taste it to your heart's content!!
hiroya, you're too excited. calm down a little.
our opponent is the cunning demon who took me and your father by surprise ten years ago.
be careful!
1111?!
there's no need to worry.
ten years anger
it's not that easy.
kah...
ka-ka-ka-ka!
*cackle*
well done...
you've done well to come this far.
i raised hatred.
it was worth sticking to spitting back then.
this is the first time i've ever hated someone so mature.
exactly the best ingredients
zaito...
i want to devour you in the best way possible.
hmph.
that wish.
know that it will never come true!
in that case
how about this?
brother...
using genjutsu to kill my sister... this is bad!
hiroya!!
gekiga
such bewilderment.
my katana won't dull now.
it may be a genjutsu, but my sister's face...
a tremendous will...!
but----
she didn't hesitate this much?!
kihii
kihihi
that's good, zaitou.
it's the best!!
your delusion.
it looks the best!!
this is not a delusion!
this is justice!
it's justice for my family!!
which mouth do you use to talk about familial love?
someone who can carve up her sister's appearance this much.
zaifuji
look at that.
just look at me.
your delusion.
expose everything to me.
ugh.
oh...
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
hiroya
what the hell's going on!?
this is...
shoki is being sucked into an old wound!?
i'll take care of arifuji!
i want to eat it in the best way possible.
curse you...
are you trying to make hiroya a demon?!!
kagamimaru!!
passion takes the most heat when a person is swallowed up by it.
hiroya, listen to me!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the delusion of revenge dominates you---
you will become a demon and become one with me, zaito!!
hang in there, hiroya!
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
that's right. come here.
it's the next sword.
with the next strike――
delusion.
i'll eat you!!
ahhhhhhhh
ugh...
ah!
give it to me.
hah...
ah...
ahhh!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
it's time to wake up.
the shikigami is struggling.
you risked your life to distract your master from me.
well, whatever...
get out of here.
fury hunting
the curse i put on you ten years ago.
it's not that easy to get.
father.
mother.
a chord...
what's the matter?
wearing a demon mask and the like
get me something like that.
hurry up and get your face...
o...ni...
y-you're...
oni... i'll kill you!
aaaaah!?
s-stop it!
hah...
hana,
se...
i can't...
i was swallowed up!
ko
no
you fool!!
gah... ah!?
he's fallen for some stupid curse.
he's still the heir to the zaito family?!
impossible.
why are you the one who was cut?!
...
haha!
why? you're asking a strange question.
-!?
to the lord's crisis.
i don’t know if i’ll be able to sleep with just a single sword
the wound.
burned?!
it's time you noticed.
well...
i held back a little, though.
ku... kureha...
he's starting to come back to his senses.
curse you...
like a shikigami
i will not stand in the way of this kagamimaru, who has lived for a hundred years!!
even on his own, he could have used such a technique.
a hundred years?
don't get carried away after about a hundred years, kagamimaru.
i've been a shikigami for a thousand years since the time of peace.
even if i'm inferior to you in strength.
this love
i won't lose to delusions.
a delusion can cover all feelings.
don't get swallowed up by that.
look at me.
feel me.
remember your family by the smell carved into your body.
don't forget your dream.
the feelings in her heart.
and...
that i'm always by your side.
it's stupid...
i won't forgive you.
such a farce.
- !?
kakyoumaru
i'm sorry, but...
from here on out
one of you is a sumo wrestler.
i'm sorry, kureha.
wound... does it hurt?
don't prove it.
i have not trained so softly that i cannot hold my ground here.
if that's the case――
please.
h-hey, wait, wait.
what are you going to do?
don't tell me――
mii
nooooooo!
ugh...
oaaaaaa!!
yeah...
the curse――
sakaiki
my delusion burns...
what a waste.
what a waste! what a waste!
what a waste, what a waste, what a waste...
curse youuuuuuu!!
a grudge that will never end.
the ultimate delusion.
the taste of what you wasted
tokuto
taste it!!
the taste of delusion.
i already know.
forgetting the pain and getting drunk on hatred
it was definitely sweet, kagamimaru.
but...
i'm done with this.
i'm done.
don't lose sight of your feelings.
kureha
...what is it?
heavy.
there's no need for you to say that!!
it doesn't matter if i don't have enough. the burn on my arm hurts, and i'm already exhausted.
at least turn me into a spirit...
hmph.
this is punishment.
punishment for pointing a blade at me.
i'll do this to your house.
i'll have to put you on the back foot for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
when he killed kakyomaru, he put on a show.
i don't know when i'll lose myself again and hurt you.
i don't have it anymore.
i don't have the right to handle you.
idiot.
i'm aware of the boy's weakness now.
on a moonless night, you may stray from the path.
that's why i'm here.
he served arifuji from the heian period.
hayasennen
chitose's feelings
your inquisition!
i see...
this is what i have to do.
now, let's see
okay, tomorrow we're gonna clean the grave!
h-hey!
don't run like that!
