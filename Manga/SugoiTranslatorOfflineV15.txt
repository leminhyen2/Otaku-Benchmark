tying eyes, shiola.
kuchitaka mitsuki
that's why...
i told you i don't know.
i don't owe you that much!
even if you say so...
raine...
there's a loan agreement over here.
you have to pay back the money you borrowed from tortillano.
i don't care!
the debt my father made at the casino...
um... um...
are you from the tortillano family?
huh? what?
we're in the middle of something! come back later!
huh? uh, um...
please wait for me!
ah, it's me.
*crunch*
you bastard...!
i'm sorry ... i fell on something blind with closed eyes
what business do you have with the mafia with closed eyes?!
uh, uh...
my name is shiola, and i'm a drifter gunman.
i heard the name of the tortillas that run the whole area
i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard...
the blind closed eyes...
gunman...?
oh, my god.
don't underestimate the mafia.
ah, it's me.
eyes closed? that's a guard?
want to try throwing out your brains from the gun in your hips?
huh? what?
u-um...
hey, don't do this! in a place like this!
.................... ........................................................................................................................
hm?
don't tell me you...
a woman?
yes... that's right, but...
oh, my god.
show me your face.
huh?
even if you have closed eyes, if you're good at trading, you can't...
no, wait...!
-?!
what the hell is this...
you bastard...
- yes?
what a show!!
you're so mean!
are you all right?!
i'm going home for today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
raine.
you're a fool.
you're...
buy a gun arm for the tortillas who've been shot at?
and then you pick a fight with bill tortilla.
he's one of the tortilla brothers, the roughest man in the city.
i see. i see.
the mafia brother of that huge man, about seven feet away...
that's right! that's right!
i'm not gonna say anything bad, so get out of town...
hm? well, that's about the height of the building.
how can you know exactly when you can't see...?
i can roughly tell by the direction of the voice and the weight of the footsteps.
you weigh a little more than five or seven feet, and you're three sizes...
wha "
you don't know that much?
i'm just kidding.
...i'm not tired.
ha ha ha.
well, i think it's about time.
we need to find a place to stay tonight.
it hurts!
.................... ........................................................................................................................
oh, come on.
here's your reward for getting rid of me.
i'll do something about that filthy outfit first.
memoto
if you don't want to be seen, wrap a towel around it.
oh, thank you very much!
i'll wash it for you.
you don't know what to do with a shower at someone's house.
uh... uh...
you're used to using closed eyes, aren't you?
oh, my god.
my dad had bad eyesight, too.
no, no, no, no, no.
it got worse, to be precise.
he's a terrible father... and a humble painter.
i used to draw naked women for money and sell them tortillas.
but i'm getting sicker and sicker.
it must have been a shock in his own way.
i guess the work cut down, the money ran out, and the grill went around.
he's trying to make me a model.
in the end, he was gambling, got into debts, and threw himself into the river.
he's a terrible father, isn't he?
...in the end.
are you a model, raine?
...yeah.
he was persistent.
i don't think i could've drawn that much money, but...
yes, it is.
that's good to hear...
you must have been very happy.
i was able to draw your daughter before she was blind.
raine?
iiit's nothing.
my back is over.
come on, look at me.
more importantly, what about you?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even those eyes...
it's not a big deal.
he shot and killed the mafia that killed his parents.
and i was expelled for it.
this eye...
then i'll prove my guilt.
.................... ........................................................................................................................
did she just crush my eyes...?
oh, my god. oh, my god.
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing terrible going on, raine.
not as tragic as a piece of your father's.
i am a heretic who sought blood of his own volition.
he can't complain about what he's done to me.
why don't you just throw the gun away!
even if you had to go through something like that!!
but...!
in that case...
throw it away?
i've had enough of this.
we only have guns and closed eyes.
i'll go get dinner.
call me if you need anything.
i'm sure it's a lie.
lies like beggars do to attract attention.
of course it is...
huh? !
d-did you leave already?
i just finished this one, too.
i'm gonna take you to your seat.
-!!
raine-san just got out-
oh, it's kaori.
it smells like hamburgers.
huh? what?
raine-san!
shit.
let go of me!
what's this all of a sudden!?
don't yell at me like that, raine.
i'm sure my brother told you a lot of things you need to know.
but that doesn't mean they're going to do this to me.
don. tortilla!!
oh, my god.
can't you do something about that manly personality?
well, whatever.
so you've got a buyer.
a buyer...?
i'm more interested in your father's paintings than in your father's.
i would love to buy you as a model.
yorobe rene.
if the buyer arrives in a few hours, the debt will be paid.
well, it's...
i don't know how they'll treat us at the shipping yard, though.
hmph.
don't screw with me!
s-someone!!
yes, sir.
it's no use, raine.
no one's gonna come crying in a warehouse this far out of town.
oh, my god.
idiots can't complain no matter what they do to you.
if your father hadn't suffered from his eyes, he would have kept you alive.
i... i... i...
what do you mean...
i don't think we'll ever see each other again, so i'll tell you.
your father was in trouble because his eyes were bad.
i told her i'd buy her another painting to cover her medical expenses.
i'm sure you're worried about verbal agreement alone, so i prepared a contract for you.
it's just that i'm so careless.
i got the wrong piece of paper.
i'm sure he wouldn't have noticed.
the contract that i signed
i didn't know it was such a big loan.
wait... dad's...
what's the value of a painter who's lost his sight?
i sent you to the afterlife because i felt sorry for you!
they're probably drawing nudes of angels by now!!
huh? what?
ow, ow, ow.
the window was taller than i thought...
hey... hey.
what's with this guy...?
shiorah?!
no, no, no, no.
i'm sorry to bother you so late at night...
i'm going to take renee here.
i came to pick you up, but...
ah, aniki!
that's the strange closed eyes i reported earlier!
what is it, bill?
you're being followed?
even if you try to poke me...
he's got eyes.
it's the smell.
the delicious smell of renee's hamburger.
i followed it all the way here, and...
it's filled with the smell of rotten meat.
i don't feel so good.
at this rate, dinner will get cold.
we're not going to pull out our guns.
please let me go home peacefully.
...............
bill.
oh, yeah. yeah.
you're an idiot who can't see what's going on.
i'll have to make him realize with lead bullets.
you're the loki that closed eyes licked.
shiorah!!
fuck you, man.
the one who shot him
that's what i'm talking about.
bill?!
fuck you, man. fuck you.
don't let them get away!!
kill him!!
...!? i can't hit it!!
what's going on?!
if you pull the trigger that roughly
i know exactly where it's coming from.
whoooa!!
*sniffle*
hey, you!
i'm not closing my eyes!!
it's spelled eyes!!
binding eyes...?
no way ...
i've heard that before...
there was a gunman who killed all the mafia in one city for revenge...
the people in the city who feared his power...
i sewed his eyelids together and drove him out of the city.
that poor gunman...
they say he's still shooting around like a ghost...
is it this guy...?
bindeyed shooter.
don't tell me this kid...
oh, my god.
which one of you can't see?
they're closed eyes. they're closed.
you idiots.
he's turning on the lights.
hold still, please.
raine.
i've had enough of this.
it's the darkness of closed eyes.
huh?
huh?
huh?
huh?
he's alive...
but... but...
just me?
are you hurt?
raine.
yeah. yeah.
shit.
my...
my family.
how did this happen?
what did you say...?
you gotta be kidding me...
then why...
dad's dead!!
wait, wait, wait, wait.
don't shoot me.
die! die!
dieeeee!!
i don't know why...
why?!
shiola!!
this guy killed my dad...
raine.
if you're going to pull the trigger
you're gonna have to be ready.
damn it...
i'm saved.
i'm shiola.
i heard you want us to hire you.
now, at your price...
did you just say why ?"
and i was like, why?
it's funny.
i can't believe you don't have the resolve to do that.
outrageous or less
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
goddamn it.
hmph.
in the darkness.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
i told you, it's okay.
you didn't have to go out of your way to see me off.
i should at least thank you.
i did it on my own.
you want to continue... shooting people?
yeah, it's...
by my eyes.
...............
that's a lot of luggage to see off.
yeah. yeah.
i'm leaving town, too.
it's depressing to be here.
it's... it's...
where the hell did she go...?
where you go.
you're happy, right?
no, you can't.
it's like i'm living in a bloody nawate.
if you're with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't think i can pull your hand.
you're allowed to cook for your benefactor again, right?
but, uh...
i knew it.
we miss each other, don't we?
going down the road alone...
i don't know....
the train's leaving.
the wings of dreams
it's solidified with wax.
the higher you fly
it'll melt into the sun.
- in that case.
it's better not to fly in the first place.
someday, i'm sure.
i failed!!
manned rocket asagao explodes!
because it's falling to the ground.
japan's first manned space flight failed!!
balloon dream.
kuchitaka mitsuki
10 years later, summer.
aikawa hitoshi
you have the academic ability to aim for a top university.
so why are you trying to get a third-rate recommendation?
i don't have a dream.
dreams...? idiotic.
if there's a safe and easy way out, you should take it.
am i wrong?
it's okay, aikawa...
for a noncute student like you
it's easy to ask for things.
- yes?
during summer vacation.
you're going to help my astronomy club.
- yes?
hey, wait a minute.
why are you helping out with unrelated club activities?
well, listen to me.
i know you like to cross the stone bridge
if you don't enter the tiger hole in the world, you won't get torako.
that's what the teacher wants to teach you.
so i'll leave the astronomy club to you while you're at the hot spring.
you just want to travel!!
oh, shit.
why would i do something like this?
if you don't help, i won't recommend it.
that's a threat, that power harassment teacher!!
tenmonbu (astronomical club)
it's right here.
excuse me, sir.
hm?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?
wh-what is this!?
...a balloon?
i'm sorry, it's a mess right now.
are you helping out, by any chance?
welcome, welcome, welcome!
to the astronomy club, full of dreams and balloons!
let's go! let's go!
i'm the director, sonoyama mizuki!
you're aikawasan, aren't you?
i look forward to working with you.
no, no, no, no, no.
what about you!?
what's with this guy...?
is there anyone else in the club?!
i'd like to get right to the point.
go home, baby.
ta-dahhh!!
balloons.
i'm going to put the camera up in space!!
you got the camera?
balloons.
i saw it on tv before!
a balloon floated up to space with a camera...
a balloon broke and fell in a parachute...
i retrieved the camera and took a picture of the earth!
isn't that exciting?
wha "
what's with that blockhead teacher!?
you're pushing this on some annoying guy...!!
- yes?
besides...
that's why there are so many balloons!
aikawasan, please puff it up too!
come on, man.
no matter how many balloons we gather, there's no way it'll float!!
mgh!
he's an idiot.
............?
what are you staring at!?
if you don't put in a helium, the balloon won't float!!
besides, why a disposable camera!?
ah, it's me.
it was so cheap...
are you going to roll a film around in space and snap the shutters!?
jesus christ.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there are tons of pictures of earth on the internet.
you don't have to take pictures of it yourself.
yeah. yeah.
well, that's because...
my dream.
is to become an astronaut and look at the round earth.
this is the first step to a dream.
that's why i really want to take pictures of myself.
i think it's very hard to talk about dreams like that
only those who've never had a dream come true.
if you're aiming to be an astronaut, you should know.
ten years ago...
japan's first manned rocket, 'asagao,' failed to launch.
you don't get much in return, and you just put people on rockets
the risk and the cost go up.
a lot of people have suffered because they failed.
manned space flight.
it's stupid not to think about the consequences.
i'm sorry, sir.
i didn't mean to...
it's okay. it's okay.
but to me
it's an important dream.
t-to help you...
i'll help you out.
recommend...
i have to take it off.
amazing~~~~!!
the camera is really flying!!
i can't believe i can take a picture of earth now...!!
no, no, no, no. i can't take it.
i told you it was just a test shot today.
huh? really?!
listen to what i have to say!
it's hard to fly high all of a sudden.
we need to get a feel for it first.
the real deal is a big balloon that can withstand a drop in atmospheric pressure in the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters.
you'll be swept away by the air currents.
i'm going to drop the gps and go look for him.
if you do it a little more this time, pull the octopus string and retrieve it.
oh... i see.
...............
mr. aikawa.
hm?
helping out
really. really.
thank you, sir.
...............
i had no choice but to go for the recommendation...!!
huh? what?
something's wrong.
it's a strange feeling.
huh? oh, my god.
this is... this is...
the thread must have snapped...
there's nothing we can do about this...
what should i do?
i have to go after him.
no, it's okay. it's okay.
it's a 2,000 yen toy camera.
and around here, it's just gonna fall into the mountains or the fields.
it's more expensive to find.
no, it's no good.
because it's important to...
something important to me.
...you.
you got something for me?
i'm sorry! i really want to go up into space!
it's very light.
but i'm sure they'll object.
of course it is!
i'm calculating my weight!
you did that on your own...!!
aikawasan...
it's me.
i'm going to go look for him.
i've been listening for a while.
you're always so fuzzy.
i can't go out with you!!
you balloon girl!!
he always goes looking for her after work...
it's really...
stupid bastard.
...............
what's a dream?
i'm home.
welcome home, dad!
jin
you're still awake?
because dad hasn't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
is that so? well, it can't be helped.
asagao is...
because it's your father's dream.
he collapsed from anxiety and said...
even though he's in charge of developing the rocket, he's still on the brink of criticism...
i can't believe i tripped on my first japanese launch.
it's the worst possible outcome.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i wish i hadn't.
huh? huh?
aikawasan?
you still have it?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
ehehe.
today, too...
i didn't find him.
- yes?
whoa, whoa!!
you... you...
she's burning up!
don't look for me until it's like this!
why did i do something so pointless...!!
for now, let's head to the infirmary...
...............
no, no, no, no.
it's not a waste...
whoa, whoa, whoa.
'cause...
my--
it's my...
because it's a dream.
sonoyama...
...............
i'm sorry, sir.
mr. aikawa.
i'm gonna throw up.
upuu!
w-wait, sonoyama!!
huh!?
i'm on my way home, so do you want to take it easy?!
you're my advisor, so at least give me a car!!
jesus christ.
for now, let's secure the footing to the drop point
let's get ready for the launch-
hey, don't be so down!!
ugh... i was in bed with a cold, and on the day of the launch...
we didn't find a prototype after all...
no matter what.
there was something i wanted to give you in space...
ora.
raise your head.
that's it, isn't it?
the important thing you put in...
it was sold ten years ago.
the limited edition key chain of asagao.
i've been wondering.
i don't know why you're so fixated on it.
that's why i was looking for you while you were asleep.
no way, while taking pictures of the earth
i can't believe you're trying to hold a memorial service for the rocket.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
come on, come on.
i'll put it on you, so let's get ready!
for me, too...
it's important to me.
...one.
let's hear it.
if you have that key chain...
you were watching, too.
where asagao falls.
how can you be so calm?
i can say i want to be an astronaut.
the dream of many people, asagao
it was the wings of a waxen egg.
you'd be worried if you saw something like that.
if we fail, we lose everything.
it's scary, isn't it?
like frustration.
like regret.
my wings.
what if it's a fake?
no, sir.
a fake wing?
when you can't fly
what really hurts when the wings are broken
i'm sure that's what it is.
because it's a real wing.
that pain is also proof that i was struggling.
that's why i...
i don't regret it.
i'm not going to die.
there it is...
there it is!!
did it really go up to space?
wh-what the heck?
are you doubting me?
no! it's not like that...
well, that's... that's...
we'll see what's inside.
the earth was blue.
that's what it feels like...
yes, sir.
ha ha ha...
hahahahahahahahahahahaha!
whaaat?!
did i say something strange?!
no, i'm sorry.
no way, really.
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
um...
mr. aikawa.
hm?
thank you very much, sir.
i'm an idiot, so i'll carry you on my back.
i'm just being selfish...
you even let me take care of the treasure...!!
it's really...
it's okay. it's okay.
i'm sure of it.
it's not a big deal.
compared to this scenery...
i'm sure it's no big deal.
i'm not recommending anything.
i'm going to study harder.
a rocket that even an idiot like you can go into space.
i'll take care of it.
i'll make it for you.
*sniffle*
what are you calling me an idiot?!
you...!
didn't you just say so yourself!?
wow, that's...
i'm glad you're not in my neighborhood.
i'm sorry...
welcome, welcome, welcome.
i-it's medicine...
she's really at her wit's end!!!
what's wrong?! does your stomach hurt?
ugh...
if you eat a rice ball that you picked up
onyaka...
it's edible, huh?
here, i'll let you use the bathroom. why don't you take a rest?
i'm sorry to disturb you...
uh, uh...
the shop that i used to work at was destroyed by fire.
he said he picked it up on the street and ate it.
i'm sorry to bother you.
no, no, no. it was a disaster.
feeling a little better?
yes, sir!
oh, right! i'll pay for the drink.
oh, i don't need the money...
huh? what?
huh!?
i don't know what to do...
uh, uh...
.................... ........................................................................................................................
if you don't have a place to work, why don't you come work for me?
are you sure!?
i wonder if i can prepare a meal and a bed... if that's all right with you.
that's more than enough.
the manager saved my life.
you're exaggerating, hahaha...
what's your name?
it's mel!
what should i help you with? "
ow!!
yeah, i'm counting on you tomorrow.
yes, sir.
it's hot, so don't burn yourself.
ugh... it's good... it's good...
i'm glad i got a stomachache...
are you sure it's okay?
...i guess it's okay.
thank you very much, sir!
i'll do my best to be useful to you.
uh, the alarm clock...
do you like frogs?
yes, sir.
good night. good night.
whaaaaat!?
i see, the alarm clock...
what a terrible volume...
how can you sleep with this sound...?
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
.................... ........................................................................................................................
maybe he was tired.
let's wake him up a little later.
oh, my god.
good morning. good morning.
ueh?!
it's already this late!?
huh? but...
i set it up perfectly yesterday.
did it break...?
it was loud and noisy.
i really didn't realize...
i'll see you later.
i think i'll ask you to clean the fallen leaves.
leave it to me!
good morning, sir.
oh, are you here to help?
yeah! are you going shopping, grandma?
you're doing well...
if you'd like, stop by.
welcome, welcome, welcome.
welcome, welcome, welcome.
welcome, welcome, welcome.
this is... this is...
does it have the effect of attracting customers?
let's get her cleaned up at a busy time...
come again!
a few days later
manager!
yes, sir.
manager likes sweets, doesn't he?
granny told the manager to have some, too!
man, i'm so sorry...
oh yeah, we have a little more customers since mel came
really!?
are you playing the part with me!?
of course, sir.
i'm glad...
thank goodness!!
i'll do my best from now on!
manager! is this my apron?!
yeah, i tried making some last night.
wow! there's a frog with it!
i guess this makes me look like a clerk.
i'd like to ask you to do some shopping today.
here's your money and notes.
i put a little more money in it.
mel, why don't you go buy something for yourself?
tenchooo...
hahaha, i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome home, sir.
ugh... i'm sorry for asking too much...
hey, hey, hey!
i bought you a souvenir.
heheh.
i'll eat with you later.
and, uh...
i want the manager to be healthy forever.
it's a good luck charm.
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
thank you. thank you.
by the way...
what did you buy for yourself?
that's what we eat together, right?
hahaha.
let's go shopping for mel next.
yes, sir!
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
aren't your hands cold?
hey, hey, hey!
i'm looking forward to going shopping with the manager.
yeah, you're right.
anyway, i need to buy mel's clothes.
yes, sir!
you know, you know...
i like my clothes bigger!
if it's big, you can wear it even if you're tall, right?
i... i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
uh, uh...
the one that peels vegetables...
peeler?
yeah, that's it!
i'm not very good with a kitchen knife.
if you have a peeler, you can peel it.
then help me cook more.
i'll be more useful to the manager!!
manager!?
you're gonna sting the onions?
oh, yeah, onions...
and they broke their stomachs and went to the pharmacy
thank you. thank you.
i think it'll look good on you.
it's your choice, huh?
this boy who was hired by fate.
he lost his job and a place to live in the fire.
and the only backpack i had.
is that all you've got?
lann.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
but he still worked with a smile every day.
i'm glad i bought a lot today.
manager!
look, look, look!
it's a frog's hat!
isn't it nice and warm?
try it on?
heheh.
yeah, yeah, it looks good on you.
like a frog.
is it cool?!
huh?!
oh... yeah, that's right.
what do you mean by cool...?
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
isn't this nice?
you need a coat because it gets cold, right?
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
is it really okay for me to wear something this formal...?
what the hell are you talking about?
it's cold if you don't do it right, right?
the lining was also a quilt.
and, uh...
isn't this good?
...it's a little girly, don't you think?
is that so? it's convenient to wear it right away.
you'll be fine if you get taller.
it's true, it's amazing.
there's also a sweater to keep you warm...
can i put it on now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry, sir.
let's go to the cooking utensil shop next!
hattenchoo
uh, you want a peeler, right?
yes, sir.
since we're here, let's buy mel's tea bowl.
go look for it, okay?
yes, sir!
!!
disposal...?
oh, it's a frog figurine.
you want it?
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
but... but...
buying it won't help anything, you know?
i'm sure he didn't want it, so he stayed.
you think so?
i thought i wanted it.
frog statues bring good luck.
maybe it's a good idea to put it in the shop.
hey, manager.
mr. frog was depressed before
you look happy right now.
yeah, you're right.
maybe it's good to have a place to belong.
yes, sir.
it's the same as me.
the same?
it's the same.
ohhh...
you look happy...
manager, leave the peeling to me!
yeah, nice to meet you.
let's buy some veggies that are easy to peel with peelers...
should i practice cutting with a kitchen knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll teach you, so why don't you give it a try?
well, then...
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
tenchoo...
i don't think i can...
i'm losing my fingers...
first, the cat's hand.
what's a cat?
i covered my fingernails with vegetables...
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
hold the knife like you're grabbing the blade from above
put the blade in your left hand.
i'm going to cut it like i'm going to push it in.
\b... i think i can do it...\u
yeah, yeah, that's it.
itadakimasu.
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
it's a big vegetable.
it's delicious to eat together, you know?
really?!
yeah, it's really good...
it's much better than my food...
i'm...
manager's food
i think it's delicious every day!
oh, my god.
thank you. thank you.
sekaiichi!!
that much!!
hahaha.
heheh.
it's warm.
yeah, you're right.
ah, it's me.
...huh?
tenchou
you all right?
i'm glad mel didn't get hurt.
be careful out there.
i'm sorry...
if you use a chair, you can reach higher places.
i'll do my best!
yeah, make sure you don't fall.
i wish i could grow up...
i'll leave closing up the store to you, then.
yeah, leave it to me!
training? you're going to be late?
that's right. it's past 9 o'clock.
you can eat dinner and go to sleep first.
all right, all right.
i'll see you later.
have a safe trip!
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
it's kinda cold...
snow...?
it's already this late...
it's later than i thought it would be.
mel... i'll eat dinner...
meh...!?
did she come to pick me up?!
bring the manager's umbrella.
*sniffle*
thank you. thank you.
i'm worried, so wait at home next time.
yeah, it's...
where's mmel's umbrella?
oh, my god.
because i have a hat.
you've forgotten...
come on, come on.
don't fall out of your umbrella.
yes, sir.
...isn't it cramped?
no, not at all.
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
there are small things you can do, right?
i always thought i was missing out.
did something happen?
yes, sir!
i'm half-full with the umbrella manager!
that's it, huh?
i see... that's good to hear.
aren't you cold?
yes, sir.
the manager's with me.
funeral house
people are not equal.
but...
death comes to all equally.
i'll see you later.
say your last goodbyes to the deceased.
no, no, no, no.
no way. no way.
i didn't think you'd come this far.
oh, my god!
that's the mama from the snack bar at 1chome!
she's the proprietor of my favorite store!
i'm still very popular!
i'm going to liven up!
a funeral home?
to create a place between the living and the dead.
........................... .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
and i'm one of them.
he's dead, isn't he?
welcome to the phantom funeral parlor.
it's called being able to see.
what? huh?
the makeup of your late sister?
president of the karasuma funeral company, cardinal karasuma, age 25.
yes, sir.
funeral client, suzume sakurano, 19 years old.
angel makeup.
that's what they say, right?
i know it's impossible.
but no matter what, i...
i wanted to do makeup on oneechan.
*sigh*
i'm not a pro yet, but...
it's a makeup egg from a vocational school!
i can do it, karasuma-san "
you shouldn't do that.
huh? !
i've never met a living girl
he must have had a very beautiful face.
why? "
mr. suzume.
i heard your sister was a famous beauty actress.
there's been a media fuss day after day.
no, not me.
are you saying you're not good enough for your sister's makeup?
that's not what i'm talking about.
oneesan's face after the accident
did you see it?
i'm sure you're right.
no, it's okay.
it's from the hospital.
i was told not to look at it too much...
the current sakurano swallow
it's not the face you know.
car accident.
it's also a headon collision to the guardrail by overspeed.
his face was torn to shreds by broken windshields.
broken bones have pierced through the skin.
we're doing a simple treatment in the hospital
you wouldn't recognize your sister when she was alive.
and i looked at your face and i said, i can't do it.
then it's a problem.
.........i...
what do you think?
but even so
are you prepared to face your sister now?
hey, funeral parlor!
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
can you not tease suzume too much?!
she's my little sister!
swallow.
you asked me to do it.
of course it is!
i don't want to be seen by a sparrow with such a terrible face!
i'm used to being hated by others.
but i don't want my sister to pull me in.
i guess that's how it is...
don't let suzume do her makeup.
hey, what's going on?
but why don't you think about suzume's feelings?
we're just a family of two.
i'll give you...
what do you know?!
anyway!
i won't accept it!!
get me another agent!
oh, and...
and?
...it's nothing!!
...anyone.
goodbyes full of regrets.
it's lonely, isn't it?
have a safe trip!
a beautiful actress, sakurano tsubame, died in a car accident.
there are a lot of rumours in the world
what do you think, everyone?
there are rumors that he was killed by someone.
she was one of the weirdest people in the entertainment industry.
what do you mean by that?
well, like a pillow... or a rookie's pickle.
it's just a rumor.
to be honest, you're not very nice either, are you?
his face and acting skills are certain, but
what's inside... right?
- we'll keep going.
i was getting closer to the truth of sakurano swallow's death
oh, my god!
i was watching.
suzumechan!
take this to table 4!
sorry to keep you waiting!
yes, sir.
that's what i'm saying.
huh? what?
funeral parlor?
doumo.
the ramen was delicious.
isn't that right?
it's our pride and joy!
you go to a vocational school while earning your own money.
i need money to go to school! i can't take a day off!
try not to burden my sister too much...
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
uh... uh...
huh? !
let's go, shall we?
huh?
where are you!?
where's your sister now?
this place is...
not ghosts.
i know where to find him.
the first is where he died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and thirdly
beside the person you love.
you know, like...
i'm actually here.
oneesan.
hehe.
is the undertaker joking?
please call me kururu.
privy...
yes, sir.
don't you feel bad about your sister?
there's a lot of rumors going around, but...
rumors are rumors, right?
you can just ask him the truth.
you know, the cardinal is funny.
...me too.
i was on it until just a moment ago.
it's in my sister's car.
on the way home from work.
the weather forecast said it would be cloudy and then heavy rain...
even though i'm busy with work.
he said, it's my birthday, so let's go eat somewhere.
he came to pick me up.
but i got in a fight with oneechan.
...about the tuition.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but i'm not.
i didn't hear that oneechan was going to pay for everything.
my parents died.
oneechan, who acted as a parent
i didn't want to cause you any more trouble...
you're still a child.
that's what i was told.
it pisses me off.
hey, suzume!
i jumped out of the car.
i hate it!
i can't believe oneechan
that's what it is.
those were the last words i said to my sister.
oneechan's accident.
it was because you went too fast, right?
i think he was probably chasing me.
after i ran out of the car
it's raining really hard.
my dream is...
i was in charge of makeup for oneechan who was on stage.
but... but...
i can't make it come true anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
oneechan died.
until the end.
i'm causing trouble for oneechan...
i don't know if it's a bother or not.
it's not something you can decide for yourself.
how's it going, actually?
swallow.
was it a nuisance?
...?
if you think i'm a nuisance "
i'm not going to be by your side "
you know better than anyone, don't you?
that's what he said.
...it's strange.
i just saw oneechan for a moment.
privy...
can i ask you to do it again?
if you're prepared to accept everything about oneechan
and it's done.
hey! hey! hey!
can i open my eyes now?
yes, sir!
today's makeup...
i'm sure of it!
...pfft.
ahaha!
i'm not good at it.
...i tried so hard.
there's still a long way to go before you can become my personal makeup.
can i become one, too!?
in charge of oneechan's makeup!
come on, man.
life isn't that sweet.
when i'm able to do makeup to satisfy me
i'll think about it.
when the time comes, i'll give you a reward.
really?!
that's why, at best
brush your arms!
swallow.
it was beautiful.
...i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
she wasn't by your side either.
of course it is!
i didn't want suzume to see me like that.
you weren't planning on fulfilling my request from the start.
it wasn't there.
if it's your real request
i made it come true.
huh...?
mr. suguru!
thank you very much!
thanks to you
i can send oneechan without regrets.
um... um...
this one.
i borrowed a makeup brush.
i'll give it back to you.
huh? !
that's...
this belongs to you, sparrow.
- yes?
...sis.
but...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
the swallow.
i'm sure he was going to give it to you when we were having dinner.
they found him outside the car.
as a memento of your sister.
even among the people in the accident
this one was miraculously intact.
i'm sure of it.
your sister was protecting you, right?
...i'm not going to thank you.
you're a stubborn one.
i'm indebted to you.
hey, hey, hey.
.........why?
isn't it a pain?
you're doing this kind of work?
i see someone crying every day
saying condolences to someone you don't know
...i don't think so.
what about you?
you can smile, right?
it's... really.
he's a busybody funeral home.
...thanks.
the sound of civilization and enlightenment
when the curtains of the night are lifted
the demonic furies never die.
no, no, no, no.
so much so that the light of man
delusions, the source of evil demons, spread throughout the world.
kureha
.................... ........................................................................................................................
...as you wish.
to that end.
we're the furies.
fury hunters and punitives
aritou hiroya
i'll recommend it.
i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.
kuchitaka mitsuki
it seems that zaito did it alone again.
the evil spirits floating around.
what a grudge.
he must have been a very powerful demon.
but it's not that simple.
as expected of a fury hunter from the onmyouji family.
i can't believe that huge demon was burned to the ground.
just as strong as the kishin.
hey, if you say kishin to her, she'll kill you.
since my family was devoured by demons
i'm a real ogre.
but it's not a mistake.
that eye.
there's definitely a demon in his heart.
if a demon had nested in your heart...
well, that's...
no, no, no, no, no!
it must have been that day.
let go of the chords!!
nii "
sir...
don't... don't...
please, don't...
oh, my god.
oh, my god.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
how dare you?
how dare you...
my father... my father.
i'll... i'll...
whism...!!
let's not do this.
visiting a grave like this
kureha?
such an offering...
every time i slay a demon
to offer my fingers to the grave...!!
.................... ...........................................................................................................................................................................
it's for my family.
look in front of the grave covered with tears.
so this is your hand...!
do you think your parents and your sister will be at ease?!
kureha
as a shikigami, i am grateful to you for serving the successive heads of the arifuji family.
but i don't.
a memorial service for my wounds and the revenge i swore to my late family.
you can't stop me.
i don't know the ache in my wound.
not you.
he'll tell me...
even me.
i hate demons.
that i was caught off guard that day and couldn't protect you.
i'm still burning with frustration.
but i don't.
more than that, i'm worried.
hiroya
your eyes are clouded.
hey, hiroya--
message!
message!
what's going on?
demon attack is spreading!
requesting backup immediately!!
yes, sir.
i'll be there in a minute.
ugh...
naosan!
the target was identified as a demon who attacked the capital ten years ago.
subject: oni-go
kakyomaru
maru...
the kaleidoscope... the hand mirror...
oh, hiroya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's the big one.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i will fulfill my wish.
he's like a demon.
*smack!*
that's ridiculous...
one or two of our best punitives...
and they're all dead...?
d-damn you!
you monster!!
i haven't been to heimdallr in a while.
i don't know what to say. i don't know.
you can eat as much as you want with this.
higuh!
huh? huh?
only leftovers.
*sniffle*
the humans in this area
i've eaten most of it.
your family's in my belly.
you don't like me?
hate, hate, hate.
it's hatred that makes me happy the most.
- oh, my god.
help me...
hmph.
it's a wakeup call.
what the hell!?
fury hunters and punitives
aritou hiroya
i've been waiting for ten years to avenge my family.
i'll send you to hell.
kagamimaru!!
arifuji...?
you... you...
that's arifuji!!
the boy i ate ten years ago...
she seemed to be enjoying it a lot.
i'm so happy, i can't stop dribbling.
arifujii...
kureha
mii
gwoh!
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?
'kokuen' of kureha, which he wore to bury you.
that pain won't go away easily.
these wounds from ten years ago.
until this ache dies down.
enjoy it to your heart's content!!
hiroya, you're too excited. calm down a little.
the enemy is a cunning demon who caught me and your father by surprise ten years ago.
be careful!
each and every one of them!?
there's nothing to worry about.
ten years anger
it's not that easy.
i... i... i...
hahaha "
*crunch*
good job...
i'm glad you're here.
i grew hatred.
it was worth sticking my nose where it didn't belong.
this is the first time i've had such a mature hatred.
it's just the best ingredients.
arifuji...
i want to eat you the best way i can.
hmph.
that wish.
you'll never see it coming!
so, in that case
what do you think of this?
nii-sama...
using genjutsu on my sister... this is bad!
hiroya!!
it's a joke.
to that kind of bewilderment.
my sword won't dull now.
even though it's a genjutsu, my sister's face...
a terrible will...!
but...
without hesitation?!
kihi!
kihihi!
that's good, aritou.
it's the best!!
your paranoia.
this looks the best!!
this isn't a delusion!
this is justice!
it's to my family!!
which mouth talks about family love.
someone who can cut my sister's form up to this point
zaifuji
hey, look.
just look at me.
your paranoia.
show me everything you got.
ugh.
oh, no, no, no.
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
hiroya
what the hell's going on!?
this is...
shoki's been sucked into an old wound!?
i'll take arifuji.
i want to eat it the best way i can.
you son of a...
are you trying to turn hiroya into an evil demon?!
kaleidoscope maru!
passion takes the heat when it swallows you the most.
hiroya, listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the madness of revenge dominates you...
you will become a demon and become one with me, arifuji!!
hang in there, hiroya!
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
that's right, come on.
that's the next one.
with the next one.
it's a delusion.
i'll devour you!!
aaaaaaaaaaaah!
ugh...
ah, it's me.
give it to me.
yes, sir.
uh... uh...
oh, my god.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
it's a wakeup call.
the shikigami is struggling.
you risked your life to distract him from me.
well, whatever...
get down, now.
rasetsugari
the curse i put on you ten years ago.
it's not going to be that easy.
chijou
mogami
whine...
what's the matter, sir?
wearing a demon mask.
i don't want that.
hurry up and put your face...
o...ni...
y-you're...
oni... i'll kill you!
aaaaah!?
s-stop it!
yes, sir.
let me go, n
se...
it's no good...
swallowed in.
here. here.
♪♪
fool!!
gah... ah!?
i got caught up in a stupid curse.
are you still the heir to the zaitou family?!
that's ridiculous.
why did you get cut down...!?
.................... ........................................................................................................................
ha ha ha.
why? that's a funny question.
-!?
to the danger of the lord.
can i sleep with just one sword?
the wound.
i baked it!?
you'll notice.
oh, my god.
i'm a little tired, though.
i... i...
he's starting to come to his senses.
you son of a...
like a shikigami.
i won't stand in the way of this kaleidoscope that has lived for a hundred years!!
i'm not the only one who's used this technique.
a hundred years?
don't get carried away in a hundred years, kagamimaru.
i've been a shikigami for a thousand years since the time of peace.
even if i'm inferior to you in strength
this love...
i won't lose to delusions.
delusions can cover all feelings.
don't let that swallow you up.
look at me. look at me.
feel me. feel me.
the smell carved into you reminds you of your family.
don't forget your dream.
the feelings that were in your heart.
and then...
that i'm always there for you.
it's stupid...
i won't forgive you.
this is a farce.
huh?!
kakyomaru
i'm sorry, but...
from here on out
you're the only one who can do it.
i'm sorry, kureha.
wound... hurts.
don't prove it.
i don't train so softly that i can't stand it here.
if that's the case...
i'm begging you.
h-hey, wait, wait, wait.
what do you think you're doing?
no way--
mii
nooooooooooooo!
ugh...
ohhhhhh!!
oh, my god.
the curse.
sakaiki
my paranoia burns...
it's a waste.
it's such a waste.
what a waste, what a waste...
damn youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
the greatest hatred, the greatest grudge.
the greatest obsession of all.
the taste of what you've wasted.
tokuto
have a taste!!
if it's the taste of obsession
i already know.
forgetting the pain and getting drunk on hate.
it certainly was sweet, kagamimaru.
but i don't.
i'm done with this.
i've had enough of this.
i'll never lose sight of my feelings.
kureha
...what the hell?
it's heavy.
so that's what you're missing out on!!
lack of anything, burns on my arm hurt, and i'm sick of it.
at least turn me into a spirit...
hmph.
this is punishment.
punishment for pointing a blade at me.
this is what i'm gonna do to your house.
i'm gonna have to put you down for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
when he killed kaleidoscopemaru, he put on a show
i don't know when i'll lose sight of myself again and hurt you.
i don't know what to do anymore.
i don't have the right to deal with you.
tawake
i'm aware of the boy's weakness now.
on moonless nights, you may be off the path.
that's why i'm here.
he served arifuji from the heian period
hayachinen
a thousandyearold's feelings
it's your trial!
i see...
that's what i'm talking about.
now, let's see.
now, tomorrow we're gonna clean the graves!
h-hey.
don't run so fast!
