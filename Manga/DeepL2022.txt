shiora with binding eyes
mitsuki kutataka
i told you!
i told you i don't know!
i don't know about that kind of debt!
that's not what i said...
raine...
i have an iou.
the money i owe tortillano has to be paid back.
i don't give a shit!
i don't give a shit about the debt my father made at the casino...
excuse me...
are you the tortillano family?
i'm in the middle of something...
i'm in the middle of something...
oh, uh...
wait!
oh, no...
gah!
you son of a bitch...!
i'm sorry... i'm blind and i fell down.
what the hell does a blind guy want with the mafia?
uh, well...
my name is shiora, i'm a gunfighter in the street.
i heard the name of the tortilla family that runs this area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard...
a blind man with closed eyes...
a gunman...?
oh...
don't you ever underestimate the mafia.
ah...
a bouncer with a closed eye?
you want me to put a gun in your hip and blow your crazy brains out?
huh?
oh, uh...
hey, stop it! not here!
...a
hmm?
are you...
a girl?
yes... yes, but...
oh...
let me see your face.
what?
even with closed eyes, if you're a good trader...
oh, no...
what the...?
what the hell...
you son of a bitch...?
what the...?
what the hell are you showing me!
oh, my god!
are you all right, you guys?
i'm going home today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
rene...
you idiot.
you...
you're the tortilleros who got their start in a shootout and now you want me to buy you a gun?
and now you're trying to pick a fight with bill tortilla?
he's one of the tortilla brothers. he's the roughest son of a bitch in town.
that's right.
that 7-foot-tall guy you just saw is the younger of the two brothers...
that's right!
i'm not gonna tell you what to do, but i'm gonna get you the hell out of town...
... hmm? i'm pretty sure bill's about that tall.
how can you tell exactly if you're blind...?
i can tell from the direction the voice is coming from and the weight of your footsteps.
you're a little on the heavy side for a man of five-seven feet, three sizes...
huh?a
you can't tell that much?
i'm just kidding.
i'm kidding. i don't get it.
ha-ha-ha.
well, i'd better get going.
i have to find a place to stay for the night.
there it is.
...a
oh, god.
thanks for the good riddance.
i'll do something about your dingy outfit first.
your eyes.
wrap yourself in a towel if you don't want to be seen.
oh, thank you very much.
i'll wash you.
you don't know what you're doing in the shower at someone else's house.
i... you know...
you're really good with closed eyes, aren't you?
yeah, well...
my father was blind too.
no, it...
he got worse, to be exact.
he was a terrible father... he was a poor artist.
he painted naked women for money and sold them to tortillas.
but then he got sick and his eyesight started to deteriorate.
he must have been shocked.
his work dried up, his money dried up, and he got burnt out.
he even tried to use me as a model.
after all, he borrowed money at a gambling game and drowned in the river.
what kind of father is he?
i... after all...
so, you're a model now?
yeah... yeah.
she was very persistent.
i mean, i probably wouldn't have made much money, but...
well...
that's great.
it must have been a great pleasure for you.
to be able to paint your daughter before she went blind.
ms. rene?
it's nothing.
your back is done.
turn around.
what about you?
why are you traveling with a gun?
and your eye...
it's no big deal.
i shot and killed the mobster who killed my parents.
i got kicked out of my hometown for it.
this eye...
i thought it was to prove my guilt.
i was...
you mean he took out your eye?
how horrible...
you're just avenging your parents!
there's nothing terrible about it, miss rayne.
i'm not a piece of your father's tragedy.
i am a traitor who willingly sought blood.
you can't blame me for what they did to him.
why don't you drop the gun!
you're not going to let that happen to me!
but...
so...
drop it?
all i have is a gun
all i have is a gun and a closed eye.
i'm gonna go make dinner.
let me know if there's any inconvenience.
it's a lie...
a lie like a beggar would tell to get your attention.
it's got to be...
oh, my god!
are you out already?
i'm just getting ready.
i'll show you to your table.
i'll show you where to sit.
ms. rene, we're here.
what a nice smell!
it smells like hamburgers.
what's that?
rene!
shit!
let go of me!
what the hell are you doing here?
don't be so rude, rene.
i think my brother has already told you what you want.
but that doesn't mean you have to go this far.
don. tortilla!
oh dear...
can't you get over your manly personality?
oh, well...
i've got a buyer for you, too.
a buyer...?
the buyer of your father's paintings is very fond of you.
he wants to buy you as a model.
i'm so happy for you, my dear.
if the buyer arrives in the next few hours, the debt will be paid.
but...
i don't know how they'll treat you when they ship you off.
pfft!
you've got to be kidding me!
who the hell are you!
ha!
it's no use, lene.
no one's going to come to a warehouse on the outskirts of town just because you're yelling.
goddamn it.
i don't blame the idiot for what he did to you.
your father would have let him live if he hadn't been blind.
what...
what do you mean...
since we'll never see each other again, i'll tell you.
your father had a problem with his eye.
i offered to buy him the next painting at a higher price to help pay for his treatment.
i knew you'd be worried about a verbal promise, so i prepared a contract.
but i was careless.
i used the wrong paper.
he couldn't see it.
i signed a contract.
i had no idea it was an iou for a lot of money.
wait a minute... so you're saying...
what's a blind artist worth?
i sent him to the other side!
he's probably painting nude angels by now!
huh?
oh, no...
the window was higher than i thought...
hey...
what the hell...
siolla?
oh no...
i'm sorry, it's late at night...
i'm here to pick up
i'm here to pick up ms. rene...
oh, brother!
that's the guy with the weird closed eyes i just reported!
what the hell, bill?
did you get followed?
i was trying to...
he's got eyes...
it's the smell.
the delicious smell of hamburgers made by ms. rene.
i followed it here, and...
it smells like stewed carrion.
i feel very bad.
if it continues like this, the dinner will get cold.
please don't pull out your guns.
please let us leave peacefully and without pulling out our guns.
......
bill.
oh, man.
for a moron who can't see what's going on.
i'm gonna have to put a lead bullet in your eye.
you're a closed eye, you're a fucking asshole.
shiora!
go to hell.
i shot you first.
you shot me first.
bill?
get ready!
don't let him get away!
kill him! kill him! kill him!
... what the fuck? i can't hit it!
what the fuck is going on!
you're pulling the trigger so hard.
i can see where it's coming from.
whoa!
ow!
son of a bitch!
that's not a closed eye!
it's a closed eye!
a closed eye...?
i don't think so...
i've heard of this...
there was a gunman who killed all the mafia in a city out of revenge.
people in the city feared his power.
they burned his eyes out, sewed his eyelids shut, and ran him out of town.
that poor gunfighter...
he's still going around shooting bad guys like a ghost.
this is the guy?
the shooter with the spelled eyes.
you can't tell me this kid...
i don't get it.
which one of you is blind?
they think i have closed eyes.
idiots!
hey, can you turn on the light?
i'm going to have to ask you to stay put.
ms. rene.
it's dark in here.
it's the darkness of the closed eyes.
ah!
huh.
huh.
haaah!
he's alive...
but...
just me?
are you hurt?
ms. rene?
yes, i'm fine.
oh, shit.
my...
my family.
what the fuck is wrong with you?
what the fuck...?
fuck you...
then why?
then why is my father dead?
wait!
don't shoot me.
die!
die!
why did you...
why did you...
sihora!
she killed my father...
ms. rene.
if you pull that trigger...
you better be ready.
damn it...
oh, thank god!
ciola, you say?
i hear you want to hire me.
i'll give you your price now...
did you just say "why"?
you said, "why?"
that's ridiculous.
you don't have the stomach for this.
you're no better than an outsider.
a
bastard.
hm.
in the dark.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
you said it was okay.
i can't believe you went to all this trouble to see me off.
i should at least say thank you.
i did it on my own.
you want to continue... shooting people.
yes...
i'm gonna put it in your eyes.
......a
that's a lot of luggage to send off.
yeah, i'm leaving town.
i'm leaving town too.
it's just too depressing to stay here.
oh, that's...
where are you...?
where you're going.
you'll be happy to see me, won't you?
no, no, no, no, no.
if you're with someone like me...
with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't expect you to back off.
i'm allowed to cook for my benefactor again, right?
but...
you know what?
we both miss each other.
going on the road alone.
well...
the train's leaving
the wings of my dreams
the wings of my dreams are waxed
the higher i soar
the higher you soar, the more the sun will melt you.
well, if that's the case
then it's better not to fly in the first place
someday you will.
it's going to fail!
the manned rocket "asagao" will explode!
it will fall to the ground.
japan's first manned space flight failed!
balloon dream
mitsuki kutataka
ten years later - summer
hitoshi aikawa
you have the academic ability to go to a top university.
so why are you going for a recommendation from a third-rate university?
you really don't have any dreams.
dream...? nonsense!
if there's an easier and safer way, you should choose it.
am i wrong?
good job, aikawa...
it's easy to ask for things
it's easy to ask for a lot of things from a not-so-pretty student like you.
what?
you'll be helping our astronomy club
you'll be helping our astronomy club during the summer vacation.
?a
wait!
why are you helping with a club you have nothing to do with?
listen.
i know you like to push across bridges.
but if you don't go into the tiger's den, you won't get the tiger's cub.
that's what i want to teach you.
so while he's away at the hot springs, i need you to take care of the astronomy club.
you just want to go on a trip!
damn it!
why am i doing this?
if you don't help me, i won't give you a recommendation.
that's a threat, that power-harassing teacher!
... astronomy club
there you are.
excuse me.
hmm?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
what the hell is this?
... a balloon?
i'm sorry, it's a mess.
are you the one who's helping?
welcome!
welcome to the astronomy club, full of balloons and dreams!
hello again!
i'm mizuki sonoyama, the club leader!
you must be mr. aikawa, right?
it's nice to meet you.
no, it's no problem.
it's nice to meet you too.
what's this guy...
is there no one else in the club?
i'd like to get right down to business...
i want to go home...
ta-da!
with a balloon...
we're going to send a camera into space!
a camera?
with a balloon.
i saw this on tv once!
the camera was flown up in a balloon into space...
the balloon breaks, and the camera parachutes down...
and when they retrieved the camera, they got a picture of the earth!
isn't that exciting? isn't that exciting?
hey...
what's a little help, you stupid teacher!
you're a pain in the ass...!
and...
besides...
that's why we need lots of balloons!
please inflate them, aikawa-san!
you know what?
no matter how many air-filled balloons you gather, they won't float!
ugh!
he's an idiot for sure.
.......?
what're you so upset about?
you can't float a balloon without helium!
why the hell is he using a disposable camera!
oh...
it was cheap...
you're going to roll a film and press the shutter in space?
damn!
it might be possible in principle, but...
there are plenty of pictures of the earth on the net.
you don't have to take them yourself...
oh.
that's...
because my dream
is to become an astronaut and see the round earth.
this is the first step towards that dream.
that's why i really want to take my own pictures.
i can talk about my dream like that
only those who have never seen the end of a dream
if you want to be an astronaut, you know what i'm talking about.
ten years ago...
japan's first manned rocket, "asagao," failed.
just putting a man on a rocket without much payback
the risk and the cost go up.
a lot of people suffered because of the failure.
manned space flight
it's a fool's errand.
i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to say that.
it's okay.
it's still an important dream for me.
it's a very important dream for me.
i'll help you.
i'll help you.
i'll help you...
i have to get it.
wow!
the camera is really flying!
i can't believe i can already take pictures of the earth with this .....!!!
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
i told you today was just a test shoot.
is that so?
you're not listening to me!
it's hard to fly high out of the sky.
first we have to get a feel for it...
the real test will be in the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters with a big balloon that can withstand the drop in atmospheric pressure.
the air currents will be very strong.
so we'll put a gps on it, and we'll go looking for the drop site.
this time, we're just a few more minutes, and then we'll pull the octopus line and retrieve it.
oh... i see.
......
mr. aikawa.
hmm?
i'm here to help you.
thank you very much.
thank you very much.
......
i had to go to .... for a recommendation!
what's up?
i don't know...
i'm getting a weird response...
oops.
is this...
has the thread snapped?
there's nothing i can do...
what should we do?
i'm going after it...
it doesn't matter.
it's just a $2,000 toy camera.
besides, around here it'll just end up in the mountains or in a field.
it'll cost more to find it.
no, no, no, no.
because it's got...
i love...
... did you...
did you put something in there?
i'm sorry! it's something i really need to get up into space.
it's very light.
but i'm sure they'll object.
of course they will!
we've calculated the weight properly!
and you just took the liberty of...!
mr. aikawa...
i...
i'll go look for her.
listen to me.
you're just spouting nonsense!
i'm not going anywhere with you!
you balloon bitch!
after we're done, she's always going to go looking for...
you're so...
idiot.
......
what a dream!
i'm back!
welcome home, dad!
jin
you're still awake?
you haven't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
really? well, it can't be helped.
"morning glory."
it's your father's dream.
he collapsed from exhaustion. i'm sorry.
even though he was in charge of the rocket's development... he had to bear the brunt of the criticism.
stumbling on japan's first launch...
that's the worst possible ending.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i'm sure he's wishing he hadn't done it.
oh...
mr. aikawa?
you're still here?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
hehehe...
today, too...
i couldn't find it.
?
hey!
you...
you're burning up!
don't look for me till you're like this!
why are you wasting your time...!
i'm going to the infirmary...
......
no, no, no...
it's not a waste of time or...
oops...
it's just...
my...
my...
it's my dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry.
aikawa-san.
i'm gonna throw up.
i'm gonna throw up!
wait, sonoyama!
huh?
i'm on my way back from a trip and want to relax!
you're my advisor, you can at least give me a ride!
damn it!
at least we've got a way to get to the drop-off point.
let's get ready for the launch!
you're so low!
ugh... i was in bed with a cold, and before i knew it, it was launch day!
in the end, we couldn't find the prototype...
i just couldn't do it...
i really wanted to launch something into space...
hey...
look at me.
this is it, isn't it?
you know what you put in there that was so important?
it was sold 10 years ago.
"morning glory" limited edition key chain.
i was curious.
i don't know what it is that you're so obsessed with.
that's why i looked for it while you were in bed.
don't tell me you're trying to take a picture of the earth while you're at it.
i can't believe you're trying to make a memorial to the rocket while taking pictures of earth.
aikawa-san...
here...
i'll put it on the board and we'll get it ready!
it's important to me...
it's very important to me.
... let me ask you something.
let me ask you something.
the fact that you have that key chain...
i know you saw it too.
the one where the "morning glory" falls.
how can you say
how can you say you want to be an astronaut?
the "morning sun" was a dream of many people.
"morning glory," which had been the dream of so many people, was just a fake wing made of wax.
you'd be worried if you saw them.
if you fail, you lose everything.
you'd be afraid of...
failure.
regret.
what if my wings...
what if my wings are fake?
i don't have fake wings.
fake wings.
when you can't fly.
when you break a wing... that's when it really hurts.
it's because they're real.
because they are real wings
even the pain is proof that i was flapping my wings
that's why i don't
i don't have any regrets
even if i die
there it is...
there it is!
did it really go up to space?
what the hell?
you don't believe me?
no! that's not why...
well, that's not...
you'll know it when you see what's inside.
the earth is blue.
i guess...
ha-ha-ha...
ha-ha-ha-ha...
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
what!
did i say something funny?
i'm sorry.
i really didn't think
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
ano...
aikawa-san...
hmm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i'm at your mercy.
i'm just being selfish...
but you even let me ride your treasure...
it's really...
don't worry about it.
i'm sure it's nothing.
it's no big deal.
compared to this view...
it's probably nothing.
i'll stop recommending you.
i'm going to study harder and build
a rocket that can take an idiot like you to space.
i'll build it.
i'll build it.
what?
how dare you call me an idiot!
you!
you said so yourself!
wow...
i'm glad we're not in the neighborhood...
sorry...
welcome...
have a... i need some medicine...
i'm in a tight spot!
what's wrong? you have a stomach ache?
ugh...
i found some rice balls... if you eat it...
i had a stomach ache...
food poisoning...
here, i'll lend you the bathroom, why don't you go rest?
sorry to bother you...
well...
the place where he lived and worked was destroyed by fire.
you were stranded on the street, so you picked up some food...
i'm sorry to have bothered you.
oh, no, no, no, no. i'm sorry.
you feel better now?
yeah!
oh, yeah! i'll pay for your drinks.
oh, no need to pay...
huh?
huh?
i don't have my wallet...
oh...
i don't have a purse...
you want to work for me if you don't have any money?
no problem.
i can get you food and a place to sleep... if that's all right.
that's more than enough.
you saved my life.
you're exaggerating.
what's your name?
mel.
where do i start?
yeah.
yeah, i'll see you tomorrow.
okay.
it's hot, so don't burn yourself.
ugh... delicious... delicious...
i'm glad i didn't get sick to my stomach...
you're glad?
i don't know... i guess it's okay.
thank you very much.
i'll try my best to be useful.
oh, and the alarm clock...
you like frogs?
yeah, i do.
good night.
noooooo?
oh, yeah, the alarm clock...
how can you sleep with that sound?
i don't know how you sleep with that sound...
hey, it's morning...
wake up...
i'm tired...
maybe he's tired.
let's wake him up a little later.
hey.
good morning.
what?
already this late?
huh? by the way...
i set it up properly yesterday.
did it break?
no, it was beeping loudly.
i really didn't notice.
well then...
i'll leave you to clean up the leaves.
i'm on it!
good morning, sir.
well, well, well. you want some help?
yes! is grandma shopping?
you're doing great...
you can come by if you want.
come on in.
come on in.
hello, hello.
this is...
it's gonna draw some customers, right?
let's have them clean up when there's more pedestrians...
come back soon!
a few days later...
manager!
yes, sir.
you like sweets, don't you?
grandma said you can have some too!
i'm sorry...
since mel came, we've had a few more customers.
really?
am i really helping?
of course you are.
that's great.
good!
i'll keep working hard!
manager! is this my apron?
yeah, i made it last night.
oh, my gosh! it has a frog on it!
now i look like a shopkeeper.
i need you to do some shopping for me today.
here's some money and a note.
i put a little extra money in there for you.
mel, why don't you go get something for yourself?
oh, man...
i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome home.
oh, no... i asked for too much, sorry...
hey!
i got you some souvenirs.
oh, wow...
we'll eat it together later.
oh, and by the way...
i want you to stay in good health.
here's a good luck charm.

thank you.
i'll... by the way...
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for us to eat together, right?
ha-ha-ha.
let's go get mel's next one.
yeah!
....
are your hands cold?
heh-heh-heh!
i can't wait to go shopping with the manager.
yeah, i'm looking forward to it.
we'll have to get mel some clothes anyway.
yeah!
you know what?
i want bigger clothes!
so you can wear it when you get taller, right?
i see... i see...
i wonder if i can grow...
is there anything else you want?
i'm thinking...
a vegetable peeler...
peeler?
that's it!
i'm not very good with a knife.
but if you have a peeler, i can peel them.
then you can help me cook more.
i can be more useful to you!
manager?
do the onions sting?
yeah, the onions...
i'm so hungry, i had to go to the drugstore.
thanks.
you look like a manager.
you pick?
i hired this boy out of the blue.
he lost his job and his place of residence in the fire.
and the only thing he had in his backpack.
is that all you've got?
no.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
but he still works every day with a smile on his face.
i'm so glad we shopped here today.
manager!
look at this!
it's a frog hat!
it looks so warm.
try it on.
hmmm...
yeah, yeah, it looks good on you.
it looks like a frog.
is it cool?
huh?
oh... yeah, it is.
cool... is...?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
this is good, right?
it's gonna get cold, you're gonna need a coat.

you don't have to dress like this, do you?
what are you talking about?
it's got to be nice and tight or you'll be cold.
it's got a quilted lining.
and...
this is good, isn't it?
it's... it's a little girly, don't you think?
it's a little girly, isn't it? it's easy to put on and take off.
and it'll keep you warm when you get taller.
that's great.
i've got some other sweaters to keep you warm.
i'm not sure if this is a good time to wear that.
i'll cut the price tag off.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
next time i'm going to the cookware store...
hey, tentcho.
i need a peeler, right?
yeah.
and let's get mel's teacups.
go look for it, okay?
yeah!
!
a bargain...?
oh, a frog ornament.
you want it?

i don't know... but...
what's the point of buying it if you don't need it?
you don't need it, you don't want it, so it's left over.
really?
i thought i wanted it.
it's good luck to have a frog ornament.
maybe it'll do you some good to have it in your store.
hey, mr. manager.
you were a little down earlier.
but now you look happy.
yeah, i guess so.
maybe he's happy to have a place to stay.
yeah.
just like me.
the same?
yeah, we're the same.
oh...
you look happy...

funeral director.
people are not equal.
but...
death comes to everyone equally.
then...
say your final goodbye to the deceased.
oh, no.
i didn't expect this.
i didn't expect you to be here like this.
ah!
that's the mom from the snack bar on ichichome!
and that's the proprietress of my favorite restaurant!
i'm still a popular guy!
i'm still alive and kicking!
what is a funeral director?
a job that creates a place for the living and the dead to spend their final days.
... oh, my god!
i'm one of them.
i'm dead, aren't i?
welcome, mortician.
i'm the one who can see.
what?
you made up your dead sister?
president of karasuma funeral home, tadasu karasuma, 25 years old.
yes...
funeral client suzume sakurano, age 19.
angel makeup.
that's what they call it, isn't it?
i know it's impossible.
but i really wanted to...
i really wanted to do my sister's makeup...
huh?
i'm not a professional yet...
i'm an aspiring makeup artist in a vocational school!
i can do it! mr. karasuma!
you shouldn't do that!
!
i never met "her alive".
but i'm sure she had a beautiful face.
why?
sparrow.
i heard your sister was a famous actress.
the media is talking about her every day.
... i'm not good enough
i'm not good enough to do my sister's makeup?
that's not what i meant.
have you seen your sister's face after the accident?
did you see your sister's face after the accident?
of course you have.
... no.
the hospital said
the hospital said i shouldn't look at it too much...
the face you see now, mr. sakurazuma...
you don't look like anyone you know.
car accident.
a head-on collision with a guardrail caused by excessive speed.
her face was torn to shreds by the broken windshield.
broken bones have broken through the skin.
she was treated briefly at the hospital.
but no one would recognize your sister before she died.
i can't just look at her face and say, "i can't do it."
i can't do it.
..... i can't do it.
what do you think?
are you ready to face your sister?
are you ready to face your sister now?
hey, funeral director!

stop picking on suzume!
she's my sister!
... swallow.
you're the one who asked me to do it.
of course i did!
i don't want suzume to see my face like that!
i'm used to people hating me.
but i don't want my sister to be attracted to me.
is that how it is...
don't let suzume do your makeup.
i know...
but why don't you think about her feelings too?
you're the only two people in the family.
you...
what do you know?
anyway!
i don't approve of this!
you'll have to find someone else to represent you!
and...
and?
and... nothing!
...... no one's ever had to say
saying goodbye with a lot of regrets
it's a sad thing to say goodbye with a lot of regrets.
thank you!
the death of beautiful actress tsubame sakurano in a traffic accident
there are many rumors in the world.
what do you think?
there are rumors that she was killed by someone.
she was an eccentric in the entertainment world.
what do you mean?
well, what's called a pillow or .... she was a pickled newcomer.
it's just a rumor.
she's not very likable, to be honest.
her face and acting skills are good, but...
but what's inside is ...... right?
we'll continue with the story of tsubame sakurano's death.
we'll continue our investigation into the truth of ms. tsubame sakurano's death.
ah!
i was watching that...
suzume!
take this to table 4!
thank you for waiting!
here you go.
i'm sorry... oh...
what's that?
the funeral director?
no...
the ramen was delicious.
isn't it?
it's our specialty!
you go to a vocational school while earning your own money, don't you?
it takes money to go to school, so i can't even miss a day!
i try to make it as easy as possible on my sister...
....
oh...!
oh...
shall we go?
what?
where are you going?
where your sister is right now.
this is...
ghosts...
they have specific places to be.
the first is where they died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and the third is...
near loved ones.
you know...
actually, i'm here.
hey, sis.
hmm.
funeral directors make jokes too?
please, call me kururu.
kururu...
huh?
you don't have any bad thoughts about my sister?
there are a lot of rumors...
rumor is rumor, right?
you can ask her for the truth.
you are funny, mr. cardinal.
...... me too.
i was in the car just before the accident.
in my sister's car after the accident.
i was on my way home from a part-time job.
the forecast was for cloudy skies and heavy rain.
i was busy with work myself.
"it's my birthday. let's go out to eat somewhere."
she picked me up.
but i had a fight with my sister.
... about school fees.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but...
but my sister insisted on paying for everything.
after our parents died...
she took my sister's place as a parent.
i didn't want to cause her any more trouble.
you're still a child.
that's what she said.
i was pissed off.
hey! sparrow!
i jumped out of the car.
i hate you.
you're my sister.
that was the last thing
that was the last thing i said to her.
your sister's accident.
she was driving too fast, wasn't she?
i think she was chasing me.
after i got out of the car and ran.
it started raining really hard.
... my dream was...
to be a makeup artist for my sister on stage.
but...
i couldn't do it anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
my sister died.
until the end.
i caused you so much trouble... i...
i... you don't get to decide if she was a nuisance or not.
it's not for you to decide.
how are you really?
mr. swallows.
was it annoying?
....?
"if i'd been bothered.
i wouldn't have been there for you.
you're my sister, you know that better than anyone.
what?
...... that's strange.
i just had a momentary glimpse of my sister.
mr. cardinal...
can i ask you again?
if you're ready to accept everything from your sister...
i'm ready.
hey...
can i open my eyes now?
yes!
i did my makeup today.
i'm so confident!
i'm... ha-ha-ha!
ha-ha-ha!
i'm not good at this.
i tried... i tried so hard.
you still have a long way to go before you can be my exclusive makeup artist.
i can do it too!
i'll be your makeup artist!
come on.
life isn't that easy.
when you can do my makeup to my satisfaction.
i'll think about it.
and when you do, i'll reward you.
really?
so keep working on your skills.
keep working on your skills!
swallows.
that was beautiful.
..... i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
i wasn't even by your side.
of course you weren't!
i didn't want suzume to see me like that.
you had no intention of fulfilling my request from the beginning.
you didn't have any intention of fulfilling my request.
if it was your real request...
i did.
what?
mr. cardinal!
thank you very much!
thanks to you.
i can send you off without regrets.
um...
here.
the makeup brush you borrowed.
i'll return it to you.
!
it's...
this is yours, suzume.
?
...... sis.
sis...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
the swallows.
i'm sure she was going to give it to you for dinner.
it was found outside the car.
we kept it as a memento of your sister's.
of all the things that were found in the accident.
miraculously, this one was unharmed.
she must have been protecting it.
her sister must have protected it.
..... i never say thank you.
you're a stubborn one, aren't you?
you're the one who needs to mind your own business.
hey, hey, hey, hey.
..... what's the matter?
it's hard, isn't it?
you do this job?
seeing someone cry every single day.
and offering condolences to people you don't even know.
i don't know... it's not that hard.
you...
you can smile, can't you?
i mean... really.
you're a nosy funeral director.
i'm... thank you.
when the sound of civilization rings out...
the darkness of the night is dispelled.
the evil demons never cease
no
the more the lights of man cover the world
the more delusion, the source of demons, spreads throughout the world.
wu hao
...
... gyoi ...
for that reason
we are rasen-hunting
rasen-hunter
hiroya zaito
i push forward

mitsuki kutataka
it seems zaito's gone off on his own again.
the evil spirit of zhangqi drifting through the area
what a vindictiveness
he must have been a very powerful demon
but
as expected of a rasen hunter from a great yin-yang master's family.
how could that huge demon be burned alive?
he's as strong as a demon.
hey, if you call him a demon, he'll kill you.
ever since my family was eaten by demons.
i've always hated demons.
but you're not wrong.
those eyes.
he's got a demon in his heart.
if he has a demon in his heart...
that's...
stop it!
it must be that day.
let go of the chord!
ni...
sir...
stop...
please stop...
ah...
ahh...
ah... ah... ah... ah...
how dare you...
how dare you...
father...
mother...
harmony...!
will you stop it?
visiting graves like this
kureha...
such offerings...
every time you kill an evil demon...
you offer your fingers to the grave...!!!!
....
it's a tribute to his family.
look at the graveside, covered in red pepper.
is this your way of showing respect...!
you think you can ease your parents' and sister's hearts?
wu-ha
i am grateful to you for having served the zaito lords for generations as a shikigami.
however...
but the wounds on my hands and the vengeance offerings i swore to my late family
you cannot stop me.
you do not know the pain of a wound
not you
you say...
even i
i hate the demon
i hate that i couldn't protect you that day when you caught me by surprise.
i still burn with regret.
but
i'm even more worried.
hiroya.
the way your eyes are getting cloudy...
hey, hiroya...
message!
message!
what's wrong?
the demon outbreak is spreading!
we need backup now!
copy that.
i'm on my way.
damn...
nao!
the subject has been identified as the demon that attacked the capital ten years ago.
subject demon.
kagamimaru.
maru...
kagamimaru... brush mirror...
oh, hiroya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's the big one.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i'll do what i've always wanted.
you're like a demon
boo-hoo!
you idiot...
it took two of our finest to defeat him...
and they're all dead?
you... you...
you monster!
it's been a long time since i've been in the capital.
it's not even crunchy.
i can eat as much as i want...
yuck...
what?
there's nothing left to eat
no.
i've eaten most of the people in this area.
i've eaten most of them.
your family's in my belly now.
you hate me?
hate me, hate me.
hate is what makes me most fun.
oh, my god.
help me...
oh, no.
you're killing me.
what the hell?
rasen-hunter.
hiroya zaito.
i've waited 10 years for my family's revenge.
i'll send you to hell myself.
kagamaru!
zaito...?
you...
that zaito!
that little brat you left uneaten 10 years ago...
you've turned out to be quite tasty.
i'm so happy i can't stop drooling.
zaito...
wujingha.
gyoi
ohohohoh?
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
kureha's "goku-en" that i acquired to bury you
that pain will not go away easily.
the scar on this hand was carved ten years ago
until this tingling subsides
taste it to your heart's content!
hiroya, you're getting overexcited.
the other one is a cunning fiend who caught me and your father off guard 10 years ago.
be careful.
one, one, one, one!
don't worry.
ten years of anger.
it won't be easy.
oh, no...
...oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
hold on...
how dare you...
how dare you?
you've nurtured my hatred.
it was worth it. i could only spit on it then.
i've never seen hatred aged so well.
it's the best foodstuff.
zaito...
i want to eat you the best way possible.
hmm.
that wish
will never come true!
well then...
how about this?
brother...
i'm going to conjure my sister... no!
hiroya!
you're a fool.
such deception...
my sword will not be dulled by such deception.
though it's a magic trick, but my sister's face...
her will is so great...!
but...
so unhesitatingly...?
kihihihi!
kihihihihihi.
good job, zaito!
that's great!
your obsession
this is the best!
this is no delusion!
this is righteousness!
it's righteousness for the family!
how dare you speak of love for family!
who could carve up his sister's body like this?
zaito.
look at me.
look only at me.
your obsession
expose it all to me.
shit.
oh...
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
hiroya.
what's going on?
this is...
zhangqi is being absorbed into the old wound!
i want to eat zaito...
i want to eat zaito the best way possible.
you...
you're going to turn hiroya into an evil demon!
kagamaru!
passion is at its most passionate when a person is consumed by it.
hiroya, listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the delusion of vengeance takes control of you...
you will become an evil demon and become one with me, zaito!
hold on, hiroya!
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
that's right, come on.
the next sword.
with the next sword...
i'm going to eat you...
i'll eat you!
aaaaah!
ahh...
ah!
give me...
haa...
ah...a
ah...a
aaahhhh!
you're killing me.
a god of ceremony is trying to make a fool of himself.
you took a risk to distract the lord from me?
well, whatever...
fall quickly!
rushan hunting
the curse i placed on you ten years ago
it's not so easy to remove
father
mother
kazune...
what's the matter?
you're wearing an ogre's mask.
take that thing off.
quickly, show me your face...
please... i...
you...
you demon... i'll kill you!
no!
no, stop!
haa...
no...
no...
no... no...
it's swallowing me.
this...
you...
you idiot!
i... huh? !
falling for that stupid curse...
but you're still zaito's heir!
you fool...
why are you the one who was cut down...!
why...
ha-ha-ha.
why? you're asking me a crazy question.
what?
the lord is in danger.
i'm not going to lie down with a single sword.
i burnt his wounds.
you burned it.
careful.
well...
that took some getting used to.
oh... give me...
he's coming to his senses.
you...
a shikigami...
you dare to interfere with the 100-year-old hanakagamaru!
he's used this much magic on his own.
a hundred years?
don't get carried away with a hundred years, kagamaru.
i've been a shikigami for a thousand years since the time of peace.
even if i'm inferior to you in power...
but this love...
will not be defeated by delusion.
delusion covers every thought.
do not let it consume you.
look at me
feel me.
remember your family with the smell that is etched in your body
don't ever forget them
the feelings that were in your heart
and...
i will always be there for you.
this is bullshit...
i won't allow it.
this is a farce.
?
kagamimaru.
i'm sorry...
from here on out
you're on your own now.
i'm sorry, kureha.
my wound... does it hurt?
don't testify.
i haven't trained so softly that i can't stand my ground here.
in that case...
i beg you.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
what are you doing?
i don't think...
yes, please.
stop!
ugh...
aah!
oh...
curse...
boundary chi...
my obsession burns...
what a waste
what a waste, what a waste, what a waste
what a waste, what a waste, what a waste...
you bastard!
endless hatred, endless vindictiveness...
the greatest delusion...
a taste of what you have wasted
taste it!
taste it!
i know what delusion tastes like
i've already tasted it
to forget the pain and revel in the hatred.
it was indeed sweet, kagamimaru.
but
i'm done with it.
i'm done.
i won't lose sight of my feelings
kureha.
... what's the matter?
it's heavy.
you're just saying that for lack of a better word!
i'm not short of things to say, but the burn on my arm hurts and i'm exhausted.
at least let me turn into a spirit...
hmph...
this is my punishment.
for pointing the blade at me.
i'll have to do this all the way home.
i'm going to have to put you on my ass for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
i was vain when i killed kagamaru.
i never know when i'll lose myself again and hurt you.
i am no longer
i'm not qualified to handle you.
you fool.
i know you're a soft little boy after all these years.
you may go astray on a moonless night
that's why i'm here.
i have served zaito since the time of the heian period.
for a thousand years
chitose's thoughts...
your fire!
i see...
i'll be damned.
well...
well, tomorrow we'll clean the graves!
hey! hey!
don't run so fast!
