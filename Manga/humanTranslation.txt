bound eye siora
mitsuki kuchitaka
i'm telling you!!
i don't know what you're talking about!
i don't owe you!
well, i'm sorry...
lene...
we've got proof here...
you know we need you to pay us back...
how should i know!?
how should i know about my father's debt in casinos...
excuse me...
are you a member of the tortillano family?
huh?
we're having a conversation here! get lost!
uh, um...
please...! wait...
ah!
guh!
hey, you...
i'm sorry, i can't see, i am a "closed-eyes"...
so what does a closed-eyes want from the likes of us!
uh...
i'm siora, a gunman
i heard that you tortillanos are in charge around here
so i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard...
so a closed-eyes is...
a gunman...?
well...
don't mess with us.
ah..
closed-eyes for a bodyguard?
do you want me to shoot your brains out?!
huh?
er...
hey, just please stop!
...
huh?
are you...
a girl?
yes, but so...?
oh well...
let's take a look at your face.
hey!
if you have good qualities, your eyes wouldn't be a concern
hey, wait!
?!
what the...
you...
?
what is this!!
how dare you!
are you all right?!
i'll leave for today.
but don't think you can stay like this forever.
lene
are you nuts?
you...
the tortillanos are notorious for their gun fights! did you really think that they would hire you?
and  picking a fight with "the" bill tortillano?
he's one half of the tortillano brothers, and the most violent in town.
i see.
so that 7-feet-tall guy is the younger one of the mafia brothers.
that's right!
so you'd better get out of this town as soon as possible.
...wait a second. bill's height is actually around 7, but
how do you know when you can't see anything...?
i can tell from whereabouts of the voice and how heavy the footsteps sounded.
you're 5 feet 7, you're slightly heavier than your height's average
what?!
how do you know that much!
i'm just kidding.
don't say that again.
ha, ha.
well, i should get going.
i need to find a place to stay tonight.
ouch.
...
ugh, fine!
i guess i have a lot to thank for.
first, we need to do something about your dirty clothes.
your eyes.
if you don't want me to see them, cover them with a towel.
well... thank you.
just leave everything to me.
you don't know how to shower in someone else's house, do you?
um...
you seem really used to treating closed-eyes people like me
ah...
my father's sights weren't good, either.
no...
it gradually got worse, to be exact
he wasn't a good father. he was just a plain old painter.
he kept drawing naked woman to sell them to the tortillanos.
but his eyes got worse and worse.
he must have been in so much pain.
he had less job, less money and
he even tried to use me as the model for his paintings
in the end he made debt from gambling, and he dove into the river.
worst father ever, huh?
so...
did you model for him?
yeah...
he was so persistent.
i don't think i made him much money, though.
well...
i'm glad...
he must have been really happy
to be able to draw his daughter before he lost his sights completely.
lene?
no, it's nothing.
i'm done with you're back.
come on, turn around.
by the way, what about you?
why did you take your gun with you?
and those eyes...
it's no big deal.
i killed a mafia who killed my parents.
and that's how i was kicked out of my hometown.
and these eyes...
are proof of sin.
...
and that's how you were made blind...?
how terrible...
all you did was avenge your family!
there's nothing terrible about this.
it's not half as tragic as your father's story.
i wanted blood.
people like me don't have a say in how we are treated.
why don't you put the gun down!
look what happened to you!
but...
then...
put down...?
what else would i have left?
if i put down my guns...?
i'll go prepare dinner.
tell me if you have inconvenience.
she must be lying.
just like a beggar calling for attention
yes, it's got to be...
!
you're done already?
i'm just in time.
i'll guide you to your seat...
!!
i'm done!
oh, it smells good.
i can smell hamburg steaks.
huh?
lene?
shit!
let go of me!
what do you want!
hey, calm down.
i think my brother told you what i want.
that doesn't give you the reason to go this far
don tortillano !!
well, well...
what's with your manly personality?
anyway.
you've got a buyer.
buyer...?
a customer who bought your father's picture really likes you.
he told me that he wanted you, because you were the model.
you'd better be happy.
the buyer arrives in a few hours, by which time you'll be debt-free
of course
i don't know for sure how the buyer will treat you.
wha...
stop joking with me...!
s-someone...!
ha
it's no use, lene.
no one would hear you  in this off-town storage.
oh well,
look how pathetic you are.
and your father. if his eyes weren't so bad i would have let him survive...
what the...
what's that supposed to mean?
might as well tell you before we won't see each other again for good
because your father was suffering from his blindness,
i offered to buy his picture at a higher price than usual.
for his convenience, i prepared him a contract
but, oops, my bad.
i got the wrong kind of paper.
with his eyes, it was impossible for him to notice
the contract paper he signed,
was an iou for billions.
wait, then was my father...
do you think a painter without sight is valuable enough?
i couldn't help but take his non-valuable life!
he'd probably be drawing pictures of angel nude now!
huh?
ouch!
the window was higher than i thought.
hey...
who's this...?
siora?!
hey
sorry to visit you this late at night.
i just wanted to...
pick her up...
don!
this kid is the closed eyes i told you about!
bill...
were you followed by him?
but it can't be possible...
his eyes are...
it's the smell.
the smell of hamburg steak she made.
i followed the scent and came here...
but this place is filled with a filthy odor.
gosh, i might not feel very well.
and the dinner will get cold if we don't hurry.
please let us go in peace.
it's for the both of us.
......
bill...
yeah.
i guess this kid can't "see" the situation she's in.
we have to let her know.
this is for making fun of us.
siora!!
die.
you
started the shooting.
bill!?
damn it, get ready.
don't let her go!
kill her!
it's not hitting her!
what's going on?!
don't pull the trigger so roughly.
i can almost see the bullets
whoa!
wha...!
she...
is not a closed eyes!
she's a "bound eyes"!
"bound eyes"...?
oh, my god.
i've heard of her...
there was a gunman that killed all the mafias in the city for avenge.
people in the city feared his power.
so they burnt the eyes, patched the eyelid, and kicked her out of the city.
and that poor gunman,
is still shooting bad guys like ghosts even today.
and that's her...?
a bound eye gunner.
i didn't expect a kid...
oh well.
who's the blind one here?
don't despise me
as a closed eyes.
he's got the lights!
lene,
hold still.
because now
i'm the only one who "sees" the situation here
"pant"
"pant"
"pant"
"pant"
i'm still alive...
but...
am i the only one?
are you all right?
lene?
yeah.
damn!
my...
my family....
why did this have to happen?
why, you say?
don't be silly.
then why?!
why did my father have to die!!
wait, wait.
don't shoot me.
die!
die!!!!
why...?
why!!!
siora!!!
he killed my father...
lene.
if you're gonna pull the trigger,
you have to be prepared.
damn it...
oh, thank god.
siora, was it?
i heard you wanted us to hire you?
i'll hire you at any price, so...
you said, "why?"
with this filthy mouth
pathetic
you're no t prepared at all
you're worthless.
!!
you're nothing.
humph
you can repent on yourself
in the blinding darkness.
i told you i'm okay!
you didn't have to see me off.
well, it's the least i can do.
oh, no. i did it for my own good.
so you won't stop shooting people?
i guess not...
i swear on my eyes.
...
that's a lot of baggage for just seeing me off.
yeah.
i'm leaving this town too.
i don't feel good staying here.
and...
where are you gonna go...?
wherever you're going
like the idea?
no you can't!
you can't stay with someone like me.
like the one who lives along with guns.
i don't need sympathy...
it's not like that.
i don't know what happened to you before.
neither do i think i'll be of much help.
i'm allowed to cook food for my saviour, right?
but...
and after all,
you know it's a bit sad
to keep walking solo.
come on..
the train's leaving.
the wings of dreams,
were coated with wax.
as it flys higher,
it'll melt by the sun.
...if so
why fly in the first place.
because someday
it failed!!
manned rocket "asagao" has exploded!
everything falls back ground
japan's first manned space flight has failed!
balloon dream
mitsuki kuchitaka
10 years later summer
jin aikawa,
you have the academic ability to enter those top universities.
why get recommendation letters for a third tiered college?
don't you have aspirations?
aspirations? nonsense.
it's better to choose an easier and safer path
am i wrong?
great, aikawa.
saucy students like you
are more easy to ask a favor of.
?
during this summer vacation,
you are going to help us with the astronomy club.
!?
hey, wait!
why should i help a club that i have no connections to--
listen.
i understand that you prefer being excessively cautious,
but like the saying goes, "nothing ventured, nothing gained."
i want you to learn from this experience
that's why i'm leaving you with astronomy club while i'm going to the hot springs
you just want some time off, don't you!?
damn it...
why me...
if you don't help me, i won't write the recommendation letter.
isn't it a threat? talk about abuse of authority!
...the astronomy club
here?
excuse me.
huh?
whoa aaaa aah !!
what the hell is this?
balloons?
oh, i'm sorry.  it's messy here.
ah, so you're the temporary member, right?
welcome!
to the astronomical club full of balloons, full of dreams!
again,
i'm mizuki sonoyama, the principal of this club!
you're aikawa-san, right? i've heard of you from our teacher.
i'm counting on you.
e, er
same here.
she's kinda...
where are the others?!
let's get into the main topic ...
i wanna go home.
ta-dah!!
with these balloons
we are sending up a camera into space
and a camera?
balloons
i've seen it on tv before!
camera floating into space with balloons,
then the balloon pops and the camera falls with a parachute ...
when we retrieve the camera, we'll have a picture of earth!
isn't it exciting?
what?!
a little help? that bastard teacher!
leaving me with all the burden...!!
?
and...
that's why we need so many balloons!
aikawa-san, please help me blow them up!
you know what?
even millions of balloons won't float if they're inflated with air!!
mm hmm
she's definitely stupid
...... ?
how can you look so surprised?
if you don't add helium gas, the balloons won't float!
besides, why are you using a disposable camera?
ah!
since it's cheap ...
who's gonna wind up the film and press the shutter in space?!
come on...
maybe it's possible in theory, but ...
there are plenty of pictures of earth on the internet.
there's no need to take on e yourself.
oh
well, that ...
is because my dream
is to become an astronaut and see the round earth
this is my first step towards my dream.
that's why i have to take the photo myself.
those who can speak of dreams like that
are only those  who have never seen how dreams end
if you're aspiring to be an astronaut, then you must know...
10 years ago,
japan's first manned rocket "asagao" failed to launch.
even if there's little merit, getting a human on board
increases both cost and risk dramatically.
a lot of people suffered from failure.
manned space flight
is something stupid people who never think twice do.
i ... i'm sorry
i didn't mean to say that...
it's okay.
even so, it's still
my precious dream
well,
i'll help you anyway.
a recommendation
i still need to get it
wow !!!!!!
the camera is really flying !!
i can't believe we can take pictures of the earth with this...!!
no, no, it's not enough
i've told you it's just a test shooting today.
is that so?
hey! you need to start listening!
it's not easy to fly it at a high altitude on the first go
first, we need to get the feel of it
in the real take, we'll use a big balloon that can can withstand atmospheric pressure. it'll reach the 30km high stratosphere
since it will be swept away by the airflow,
we should put a gps transmitter and search the fall point.
this time we'll keep it simple. pull the string and retrieve, got it?
ok, i see.
...
aikawa-san,
yes?
thank you
very much
for helping me.
...... !!
i just wanted to get my recommendation letter...!!
huh?
there is
a weird feel...?
oh, no...
well,
the thread is broken.
there's no helping it
oh, goodness...
i have to follow it.
no, we don't have to.
it's only a 2,000 yen toy camera inside.
besides, it'll just fall into the mountains or the fields.
it costs more to look for it.
no, no!
because i put ...
something really important in there ...
...you
you put something in there and didn't tell me?
i'm sorry! but  i really want to send it to space.
it's very light, but...
i knew you'd oppose.
of course!
i've calculated the precise weight!!
and you've ruin it without asking ...!!
aikawa-san...
i,
i'm going to go look for it.
from the very beginning
you've been blabbing on without any content
i can't stand it anymore !!
you balloon girl!
she's been looking for it everyday after our regular process
truly...
what an idiot.
......
a dream? bullshit.
i'm home.
dad! your back!
jin
you should be in bed by now
it's cause you didn't come home...
you're working too hard.
really? well, i can't help it.
"asagao",
is my dream.
he fell ill from stress and passed away.
he was the development manager of the rocket, but did he deserve to be on the brunt of blame ...
failing to launch japan's first manned rocket,
the worst ending, no doubt
pretty sure that he's in heaven,
wishing he never contributed
huh?
aikawa-san?
you're still here?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet!
heh heh...
today
i couldn't find it again
!?
hey!
you,
you have a really bad fever!!
why did you continue looking till you ended up like this?!
why are you sacrificing yourself for this waste..?!!
let's go to the nurse's office right away.
......
you're wrong.
it's not wasteful.
hey!
because...
it's---
my...
dream.
sonoyama ...
......
i'm sorry...
aikawa-san.
i feel like throwing up
"retching"
wait, wait, sono- yama!!
what!?
you need a rest coming back from your time off!?
you're the advisor. at least give us a ride!!
geez...
at least, we can get to the fall point.
we should start preparing for the launch soon.
hey! stop with the negativity!!
uh... it's already the day of launching while i was sick in bed...
in the end, i couldn't find out the prototype model...
there was something
i really wanted to send up into space...
hey,
look up.
this is it, right?
the thing that's so important to you.
it was sold ten years ago,
key chain of "asagao". limited edition
i was wondering
why you were so passionate
so i looked for it while you were in bed.
it never occurred to me that aside from taking pictures of the earth,
you were planning memorialize and pray for the rocket
aaa aikawa- shan...
come on!
i'll include the key chain in the measurement, so hurry up and get ready!
it's something very important
for me, too...
let me know
one thing
the fact that you have that key chain
you must have saw it too...
when the "asagao" fell
how, without hesitation
can you say you want to be an astronaut?
"asagao" was a dream for many people
but it couldn't fly. it's wings were made of wax.
didn't you feel afraid
that you may lose everything you ever worked for
don't people feel scared..?
of the discouragements,
the regrets
of the possibility
that your own wings might be fake?
no.
there's no such thing as fake wings
you may not be able to fly,
it may be painful when your wings break
but that's because
those wings are genuine.
the pain itself is proof that you've tried to fly.
so,
i'll have no regrets
not even in death
there it is ...
there it is!!!
i wonder if it really went up into space?
hey, come on!
are you in doubt?
no, no, that's not what i meant!
well,
we'll find out as we check the data.
"the earth was bluish!"
that's how it feels like.
ha
haha...
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
what?
did i say something funny?
no, i'm sorry.
no, really.
i didn't expect we'd be able to take pictures by balloons!
hey
aikawa-san.
yes?
thank you so much!
i was too stupid to do anything useful
i've also been selfish, but...
you even let me put my treasure on ...!!!
really ...
it's okay.
in fact,
it's not a big deal,
compared to this view...
i'm sure it's nothing.
i won't get a recommendation.
i'll study harder,
and create a rocket that even someone who's stupid like you can go to space!
someday,
i promise!
who is stupid!!
who is stupid!!
you..!
you said so yourself, didn't you!?
wow...
i'm glad it wasn't in my neighborhood.
excuse me...
come in.
can i have some medicine...
oh, god he looks so desperate!?
what's wrong? is it your stomach?!
uh...
i picked up a rice ball and i ate it.
then my stomach...
food poisoning...
take some rest here. you can use the bathroom, if you want.
thank you...
let's see...
you were working for a shop and it went on fire...
but you had to eat something and you picked up a rice ball...
i'm sorry for all the trouble
no, no. it's okay.
you feel better now?
yup!
oh, yeah, i'll pay for this.
oh, don't worry about it.
hmm...
no way!
my wallet's gone.
oh...
...
why don't you work here if you don’t have any plan?
really?
i think i can afford you a shelter and some food. is that ok?
that's more than enough!
you've saved my life, manager!
oh no, don’t exaggerate.
by the way, what’s your name?
i’m mel!
so what should i help you with... ah?!
ah?!
you don’t have to work today...
here you go
be careful, it’s very hot.
oh my god... it's delicious...
i was lucky that i had a stomachache...
w-was it??
after all, i guess it was...
thank you so much.
i'll do my best to help you tomorrow.
where's my alarm clock...
you like frogs?
yeah.
good night.
what ?!
i see, the alarm clock...
why is this so loud...
how can you be still sleeping with this sound?
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
...
maybe he was tired.
i'll wake him later.
hey.
good morning.
what ?!
i'm late!!
but wait...
i thought i set this up yesterday.
is it broken?
no way. it went off so loud.
so he really didn't hear it...
okay then
i want you to rake the leaves first.
i got it!
good morning.
hello, are you helping here?
yes! how about you? shopping?
it looks like he's doing well...
stop by, if you don't mind!
hello.
hello.
hello.
maybe...
he's calling in more customers...
i'm making her rake when there's a lot of people on the street
come again soon!
a few days later
manager!
here you go!
i know you love sweets.
the old lady told me to give some to you!
wow, thanks.
by the way, we're having more customers since you came here.
really?
i'm being helpful?!
of course.
thank god...
thank god!
i'll work harder from now on!
is this apron mine?!
yeah, i made it last night.
great! there's a frog, too!
now you look much more like a staff.
today, i want you to go shopping.
here's some money and a shopping list
i put a bit of extra money here,
so mel, buy something for yourself.
manager...
ha ha. i'm counting on you!
leave it to me!
i'm home.
welcome back.
i'm sorry, maybe i asked too much...
it's fine!
i bought some souvenirs for you!
he he.
let's eat them afterwards.
oh, and...
i wish you good health forever, so...
i got a talisman for you!
...
thank you.
...by the way
what did you buy for youself?
that's for us two, right?
ha ha ha!
then let's go buy yours next time!
yes!
...
aren't your hands getting cold?
i'm fine!
i'm really looking forward to shopping with you!
yeah.
but first, we have to buy your clothes.
yeah...
by the way,
i think larger clothes will be better.
then i can wear it even i grow bigger, right?
oh... i see.
will you really grow...?
is there anything else you want?
um...
the tool to take off the vegetable skin...
a peeler?
that's it!
i'm not so good with knives, but...
with peelers, i can peel better.
then i can help you cook more!
you know, i always want to be your help!
tencho?
is the onion making your eye burn?
oh... yeah, it's just onions....
this boy ran into my store with a stomachache.
thank you.
looks good on you.
but choose your own first.
one thing led to another and i ended up hiring him.
he said he lost his house and job by fire,
and the only thing he had in his backpack was...
that's all?
yeah.
just some clothes and a small wake-up clock.
but still, he works with smiles every day.
and today he is enjoying shopping.
tencho!
look, look!
it's a frog beanie!
it looks warm, doesn't it?
why don't you try it on?
hehehe.
yeah. it looks good on you.
you're so cu...
cool?!
eh?
oh, yeah, you're right.
what do you mean "cool"?
oh, and...
how about this?
it's gonna get cold, so you'll need a coat, right?
...
are you sure i deserve such a nice clothes...?
what are you talking about?
how can you keep out the cold without a coat?
it's quilt inside, it must be warm.
and...
and... how's this?
um...isn’t it too girly?
is it? i thought it's easy to wear,
and it'll fit you even if you grow bigger.
wow! that's awesome!
also get yourself sweaters so that you’ll stay warm...
do you think i can wear it now?
okay! i'll take off the tag.
thank you.
let's go to the grocery store next.
yes, tencho!
you said you wanted a peeler, right?
yeah.
let's also get your cup!
go and find one yourself.
got it!
!!
disposal ...?
oh! it's a frog ornament!
you want it?
...
but...
buying it won't do you any good, will it?
that's why it's here...
is that so?
i'd love to keep it.
you know, frog's ornaments bring good luck.
maybe good things will happen if we put it in our shop.
hey, tencho.
this frog looked sad back in the store.
but he looks happy right now.
yeah.
maybe he's happy to know where he belongs to.
yeah.
he's just like me.
the same?
yeah, the same.
wow...
he looks so happy...
leave the peeling to me, tencho!
yeah, i'll leave it to you
and i'll get vegetables easy to be peeled with peeler...
do you want to try cutting them with a knife?
do you think i can do it?
i'll teach you. just try it.
well...
...
tencho...
i don't think i can manage it
i'm almost cutting off my finger...
...first, make your left hand like a cat's.
like a cat's?
hold the vegetable with your fingers curling into a claw just like cats.
that's right.
grip the knife from above just like holding the blade,
place the flat side of the blade against your claw,
push the knife forward and cut.
...i'm starting to feel like i can do it...
yes, that's it.
let's eat!
....
big vegetables.
the bigger the better. they're more filling
really?!
yes, it's really good...
much better than when i cook...
i...
think the meals you make...
i think it's delicious! every day!
oh...
thank you.
the best in the world!!
huh, that delicious?!
ha ha ha
hehehe.
i'm feeling warm now.
me too.
ah!
...what?
tencho
are you okay?
i'm relieved you didn't get hurt.
be careful, okay?
i'm sorry...
i can reach higher places by standing on a chair!
i'll do my best!
yeah, but make sure you don't fall.
i want to get much taller...
well, make sure you lock the door.
yeah, leave it to me!
...are you going to the pharmacist training? will you be late tonight?
well, i'll be home after 9:00, maybe.
don't wait for me. have dinner and go to bed, okay?
okay.
i'm going.
good luck!
....
it's somehow cold...
snow...?
it's already pretty late...
i'm later than i expected.
mel... wonder if she ate dinner as usual...
mel...!?
you came here to pick me up?
i brought your umbrella
atishoo!
thank you.
but you get me worried. wait at home next time.
yeah..
where's your umbrella?
ah
i have my hat, so...
you forgot your umbrella...
then
try to stay underneath this umbrella
yeah!
it's small, isn't it?
not at all.
...
i didn't know small can sometimes be good.
i've always thought that being small is not good.
then why did you come to think so?
well,
because i can share an umbrella with you!
oh...
...that's good to know.
aren't you cold?
no.
because you're with me!
welcome, ghost undertaker
people are not created equal
but
"death" is equal to anyone.
well then
the last farewell to the deceased
well
i didn't imagine
so many people would come to miss me
oh!
that woman is the hostess in the bar at block-1
that is the owner of my favorite restaurant!
i'm still so popular!
i feel so alive!
the job of an undertaker
is to set up the last place for the living and the dead
well, i'm afraid
particularly, i ...
you're already dead ...
welcome, ghost undertaker @kilightit
... am one of those who can "see"
hmm
you want to put on your late sister's make up?
karasuma undertaking ceo kururu karasuma (25)
yes...
client: suzume sakurano (19)
"postmortem care,"
we call it
i know this might appear to be impossible
but i really and truly
want to put makeup on my sister by myself
hmm
i'm not a professional makeup artist yet,
but i'm studying it at technical college!
i can do it without fail, karasuma- san!
no, you shouldn't do it.
!
i've never met her when she was alive,
but still, i'm sure that she was so beautiful
why is that?
suzume- san
i hear that your sister was a famous beautiful actress
it's featured in the news every day
do you mean ...
i'm not skilled enough to put her makeup on?
no, that's not what i mean...
did you see ...
her face after the accident?
of course not.
no ...
the doctors told me
it would be better not to ...
now, your sister tsubame sakurano ...
does not look like she used to be at all ...
the car accident
a head-on crash into guardrails from overspeed
her face was seriously injured by the broken windscreen...
...and the broken bone pierced her skin
the doctor did some treatment in the hospital,
but nobody will find that it's your sister
you can't refuse putting on makeup
after seeing her face.
i
what do you think?
have you changed your mind?
or, are you ready to face your sister?
hey, mr. undertaker!
the deceased tsubame sakurano (25)
will you stop bullying suzume?
she's my sister!
tsubame-san...
you are the one who asked me
yes, of course!
i can't let suzume see my ugly face!
i'm used to being hated by others
but i can't stand being hated by my sister!
hmm...
to stop your sister from putting on your makeup
aren't you?
but how about taking suzume-san's feelingsinto account?
you are her only family
what
do you know ?!
anyway!
i'm not allowing her to make me up!
get someone else!
and ...
and what ?
...no, nothing.
well
a farewell full of regrets
that's sad for everybody
welcome!
actress tsubame sakurano's death in a traffic accident
there are many rumors about it...
what do you think?
some people say that she was murdered...
she was kind of eccentric in the entertainment industry
what do you mean?
sleeping around for business and bullying young actresses ...
but they're only rumors.
actually, many people didn't like her
though she had the looks and good acting
but her personality ...
stay tuned.
...the program continues after the commercial break
ah!
i was watching it!
suzume-chan!
take this to table-4!
thanks for waiting!
okay!
....
huh?
mr. undertaker?
hi.
the ramen was delicious!
right?
it's our signature taste!
are you working to earn your own tuition?
yeah. the school costs a lot, so i need to work hard!
i don't want to put a burden on my sister
....
oh
!
let's go
huh ?
where ?
to your sister.
this is...
ghosts ...
... stay in three places
first, the place where they died
second, the place of their graves
and third...
close to someone they loved.
...apparently
actually, your sister
she's here now.
ha ha
mr. undertaker. you are kidding me.
please call me kururu.
kururu-san
you
don't you think ill of my sister?
there are lots of gosships about her...
gossips are gossips
i can always ask her the truth.
kururusan,you are　funny.
i...
...was in my sister's car
right before the accident.
i was on my way home
it was forecasted to rain heavily
i knew she was so busy,
yet she came to give me a ride to celebrate my birthday
right to my workplace
but we had a quarrel
about my tuition fee
i wanted to pay it by myself
but
she insisted that she would pay all.
my sister...
...raised me up after our parents had died
i didn't want to trouble her anymore
"you're still a little child."
she said
and i was  so irritated...
wait! suzume!
and jumped out of the car.
!!!
i hate you!
and that
was the last conversation we had before she died.
the reason of the accident...
was overspeeding, right?
she was probably trying to catch up with me
since after i left the car
it started raining heavily.
my dream
...was to help my sister wear makeup when she acts on the stage.
but now
the dream would never come true.
it's my fault ...
because of me
my sister died...
i
i troubled my sister until the end of her life...
are you sure you troubled your sister?
that's not something you decide
how was it actually
tsubame-san?
were you troubled by her?
....?
"if i thought i was troubled."
"i wouldn't have been on your side"
"you know how i feel, right? you are my sister."
that's what she says
...it's strange.
i just saw my sister
kururu-san
can i ask a favor of you again?
i'm ready to accept everything about my sister
i'm ready for it
hey
can i open my eyes now?
yeah!
today's make up...
i think i did a pretty good job!
ha
ahaha!
this is terrible!
i tried my best...
you need more practice ...
do you think
i can be your beautician?
hey
life is not that easy
when you become skilled enough...
i'll think about it.
when the time comes, i'll reward you!
really?
yes!
so keep on practicing!
tsubame-san
you were so beautiful
i am always beautiful!
why are you being sulky?
you weren't with suzume-san during funeral.
of course not!
i didn't want suzume to see my face like that!
you were not going to stop her...
...from the beginning.
please don't worry.
i complied with your wish.
my wish?
kururu-san!
thank you very much!
the makeup brushes you lent me.
i can say farewell to my sister without regret
and ...
i...
i'll give these back to you.
the makeup brushes you lent me.
!
oh
these brushes belong to you, suzume-san.
?
a present
from my sister ...?
tsubame-san was going to give these to you as birthday present.
your sister ...
she was probably going to hand these to you during the dinner
the police found them,
and we were keeping them.
this box was the only thing
that was undamaged in that terrible accident
maybe
it was protected by your sister.
i won't thank you...
you are so stubborn
none of your business!
okay okay
why ...
don't you feel tired?
why do you do this kind of work?
everyday, you see others crying...
...and express sympathy to people they don't know...
not really
at least
i can help you smile, right?
that's
none of your business
but thanks
the sound of the opening of civilization howls
the veil of night is swept away
but no end to the evil spirits
no.
the more "hope" covers the world ...
the demons deeprooted obsessions spreads across this world.
kureha
...
..yes, sir.
that is why
we demon hunters exist.
i,
hiroya arifuji,
shall welcome the demons myself.
demon hunting
mitsuki kuchitaka
i heard that arifuji guy did it alone again.
the spirit of demons drifting around...
i can feel the grudge!
must have been a pretty powerful one
but...
as expected from the demon hunter of the great onmyoji family
the giant demon's burned down to a crisp...
his strength is demon like
shut it. he'll kill you if he ever heard you say that.
ever since his family was devoured,
demons disgust him
but you're right
those eyes
his spirit is that of a demon.
the origin of his "demon" spirits...
it ...
nooo! stop!
must have come from that day.
let go of kazune!!
bb...
brother..
stop...
don't...
uh...
ahhh ...
aaaaaaaahhhhh
... dare you
how dare you...
father...
mother...
and kazune...!!
let's stop it.
visiting the dead like this
kureha
and such offerings ...
every demon you slay,
you bring their fingers as offerings..!!
...i...
..dedicate these fingers to my family
feel the oddness surrounding the tomb?!
is this the way you show your respects...?!
do you think your parents and your sister will be able to rest in peace?
kureha
i am truly grateful to you, serving and watching over my family for generations
but...
i swore to this scar on my hand and my deceased family. i will avenge.
you can't stop me.
you don't feel the throbbing of my wound
you will never
so be it...
i..
hate the demons as much as you do
the day we were attacked, i couldn't protect all of you.
even now, i'm overcome with the regret and pain.
but...
it's not my biggest concern
my biggest concern is you, hiroya
your eyes are losing light by the day
hey, hiroya
beep
beep
what's wrong?
demon alert! damage is spreading! seeking support!
demon alert! damage is spreading! seeking support!
copy that.
we're on our way.
...
furthermore
the target has been confirmed identical with the demon which attacked the capital 10 years ago
the demon's target id is
kakyomaru
kakyo,,,
maru
hiroya...
your eyes.
it's like...
big shot
let's go, kureha
tonight, i shall get my revenge
a demon.
what
impossible ...
12 elite demon hunters were hunting him down
what do you mean they're all dead?
...you
you monster!
it's been a while since i've come to the capital
merely a child's play.
isn't it like a buffet?
guh!
oh?
must have slipped away from my plate
huh..!
the humans in this area ...
i devoured them all.
your family is in my stomach, too
you hate me?
hate all you want
hatred is the best entertainment for me
ーhelp
help me..
hmph
oh, kill-joy
who are you?
demon hunter
hiroya arifuji
i have waited 10 years to wreak vengeance on you
i'll send you to hell
kakyomaru!!
arifuji..?
you're
"the" arifuji?!
the little kid i forgot to devour 10 years ago
you've become quite a tasty meal.
ohh my mouth won't stop watering
arifujii
kureha
yes, my lord
guh!
aaaaahhhhhh!?
kureha acquired this skill "goku-en" in order to  defeat you.
the pain won't be easy to get rid of
this wound was carved on to my hand 10 years ago
until the throbbing fades
take this!!
hiroya, you're using too much energy. calm down.
the thing in front of you took both your father and i by surprise.he's pure evil.
be careful...
?!?!?!
no worries.
ten years of hatred
it's not that easy to conquer
ka...
kah! kah!
ka ka ka!
well well
oh  my
you nurtured your hatred well!
at that time, it was worthwhile to hold back
this is the first time i've come across such matured hatred
the best treat.
arifuji
i want to devour you in the best way possible.
hmph
that wish
will never come true!
in that case,
how's this to your liking?
brother...
giving an illusion of his sister...damn it!
hiroya!!
stupid
that sort of idiocity
not nearly enough to slow down my sword
fake, yes, but slicing his own sister's face..?
such will..!
but...
without a hint of hesitation?!
khee hee!
hee hee hee!
good, arifuji
this is great!
your obsession
it's awfully appealing
this isn't about obsession!
this is about justice!
for my family!
who are you to speak of love?
you slashed your sister's body to this extent.
arifuji
look.
just look at me.
your blind obsession
expose everything to me.
guh!
wha...
a a a a a a a h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h !!
hiroya
what the hell is going on?
this is...
the  devilish air is being sucked in to his scar!?
i want to devour arifuji --
in the best way possible
son of a...
you're planning to turn hiroya into a demon!
kakyomaru--!!
people get so indulged in their obsession when they are taken over by it.
hiroya listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the obsession for revenge dominates you--
you will become a demon... and become one with me...arifuji!!
hang in there, hiroya!
ooooo!
that's it. come on.
the next sword, the glory.
with the next sword...
obsession.
i'll eat you!
aaaaaahh!
unh...
ah!
kure...
hmg..
uh...
ahh!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah !!
killjoy
fighting for your master, but in vain...
sacrificing yourself for loyalty
well..
fall to the dark side
demon hunter
the curse i put on you ten years ago
it's not something that you can easily get rid of
father.
mother.
kazune..
what's the matter?
wearing masks like that
take it off.
please show me your fac.....
de..mon..
you're...
demon ... kill!
---!?
no, no!
g..
get off ...

i can't...
i'm falling...

falling for the curse like that..!
and you call yourself the rightful bloodline of house arifuji??
impossible
you got slashed!
...
ha, ha.
why, you say? such a funny question
--!?
how can i be absent
for my master's crisis
she's burning..
her wound--!?
healing hack
well...
it was a pretty big blow, though...
ku..kureha...
oh no ...he's gaining back his sanity
you
the likes of you...
i'm kakyomaru, a century's worth like you do no to interfere with me!!
so much  power coming from him solely
a century?
don't get too carried away for a hundred years.
i've been the house god for a millenium, since the heian era
you may be superior in power
this love...
will not lose to obsession
obsession can take over all kinds of thoughts
don't give in to such things
look at me.
feel me.
breathe in this inscribed smell and remember your family
you can't have forgotten
the thoughts you had in your heart
remember...
i'll always be there for you.
bollocks..
this is
unacceptable
what?
kakyomaru
don't feel bad
but from here on
you'll be battling against nothing but yourself
sorry, kureha
you must be in so much pain
don't underestimate me.
i wasn't that soft training on myself, you know
well... then...
now
wait
what are you doing
wait...
yes, sir
stop!
unh...
aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
oh, god.
the curse...
the evil spirit
the obsession, it's burning away...
what a waste.
what a waste. what a waste.
what a waste, what a waste, what a waste...
damn you!
all the splendid hatred
the wonderful obsession...
you've wasted all my precious food
do ...
have a little taste!!!
i already know
that taste of obsession
getting drunk in hatred, and forgetting the pain
indeed it was sweet and easy, kakyomaru
but...
i won't fall for it
i will not
not any more.
--kureha
...what?
you're heavy
is that all you've got to say?
i mean, the burns on my arm hurt, and i'm exhausted.
can't you turn into your spirit form?
hmm
this is a punishment.
you pointed your blade at me
your punishment is to take me home like this
you have to take my orders for a while
kureha...
i'm weak.
i was ostentatious today, facing kakyomaru,
but i could lose sanity anytime. i could even hurt you again.
i can't...
i have no right to be your master
idiot
i'm well aware of your weaknesses.
at times, you may lose the track on a moonless night
but that is what i'm here for
i've served the house of arifuji since the heian period
for a thousand years.
the millennium's worth affection
will be your beacon of light!
i see...
you beat me
well!
tomorrow we clean the graves!
hey!!!
don't start running all of a sudden!
