the eye that binds.
kuchitaka mitsuki
that's why...
i said i don't know!
i don't owe you that!
that's what i said.
raine...
there's a loan over here.
i need you to pay tortillano back the money she borrowed.
i don't care!
the debt my father made at the casino...
um...
are you from the tortillano family?
huh?
we're in the middle of something! get back in there!
uh, um...
please wait!
ah!
gah!
damn you...!
i'm sorry... i tripped over an invisible closed eye "
what do you want with the mafia with closed eyes?!
uh, uh...
my name is shiola, and i'm a drifter gunman.
i heard the name of the tortilla family that runs this area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as your bodyguard...
blind closed eyes...
gunman...?
oh, my...
don't underestimate the mafia.
ah!
a bodyguard with closed eyes?
would you like to blow your brains out of your hips with a gun?
huh?
uh, um...
hey, stop it! over here!
...
hm?
could it be that you
a woman?
yes ... that's right, but ...
hoh.
let me see your face.
eh?
even if you close your eyes, if you're good at it
hey, wait...!
- what!?
what the hell...
you bastard...
?
what the hell are you showing me?!
that's terrible!
are you okay?!
i'm going home today.
but don't think you can do this forever.
raine.
are you an idiot?
you're...
can you buy a gun arm for the tortilla family that's made up of shootings?
to sell a fight to bill tortilla at the end of the day
he's one of the tortilla brothers, the roughest man in the city.
i see.
a giant, about seven feet tall, the brother of the mafia brothers "
that's right!
i won't say anything bad, so get out of town...
...hm? that's the height of the building, yes.
how do you know exactly when you're blind...?
you can roughly tell by the direction your voice is coming from and the weight of your footsteps.
you weigh a little more than five or seven feet, and three sizes...
wha--
don't you understand that much?
i'm just kidding.
...this is not good.
haha.
well, i think it's about time
we need to find a place to stay tonight.
ow!
...
ugh, geez.
here's something for your trouble.
first of all, i'm gonna do something about that filthy outfit.
memoto
if you don't want me to see you, wear a towel.
thank you very much!
i'll wash you.
you don't know what to do with someone else's shower.
um... uh...
you're used to handling closed eyes, aren't you?
uh...
my father had bad eyesight.
no, no, no.
it got worse, to be precise.
he's a terrible father... a plain painter "
he only drew naked women to sell them to tortilla for money.
but my eyes are getting worse and worse because of my illness.
it must have been a shock for him to be a painter.
you've lost a lot of money to work, and you've been baking.
he's trying to model me.
at the end of the day, i got into debt by gambling and dobon in the river.
you're a terrible father, right?
in the end...
is rene modeled on you?
...yeah.
it's because i was persistent.
it wouldn't have been much money to paint me, but...
yeah...
that's good...
you must have been very happy.
i was able to paint your daughter before she went blind
mr. rene?
it's nothing.
my back's done.
come on, come on, come on.
what about you, anyway?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even those eyes...
it's no big deal.
he shot and killed the mafia that killed his parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown for that charge.
these eyes...
at that time, i was told to prove my guilt.
...
her eyes were crushed...?
what a terrible...
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing terrible about it, mr. rene.
it's not as tragic as a fragment of your father's.
i'm an outrageous man who sought blood out of himself.
he can't complain about what he's done to me.
why don't you just drop the gun!
even after what happened!!
but...
in that case...
do you want to throw it away?
i've had enough of this.
there's only guns and closed eyes.
i'll get dinner ready.
let me know if there's anything inconvenient.
it must be a lie.
lies like beggars do to attract attention.
of course i do...
!
d-did you get up already?
i'm just getting started.
i'm gonna take you to your seat.
-!!
mr. rene just got back!
ah, kaori.
smells like hamburgers.
huh?
mrs. raine.
shit.
let go of me!
what are you suddenly doing!
don't yell at me like that, rene.
i'm sure my brother told you a lot about what happened.
but that doesn't mean they're going to do this much.
don. tortilla!!
oh, my god.
i wonder if that manly personality will work out somehow.
well, whatever.
you've got a buyer.
a buyer...?
i'm much more interested in you than your father's paintings.
he wants to buy you as a model.
glad to meet you, raine.
if the buyer arrives in a few hours, the debt will be settled.
but of course
i don't know what they'll do to you at the shipping site, though.
heh.
don't screw with me!
wh-whoa!!
hah!
it's useless, rene.
no one's gonna come yelling at me in a warehouse this far from town.
oh, my god.
i can't complain no matter what you do to me.
if your father didn't suffer from an eye disease, i would have kept him alive.
wh--
what do you mean...
i'm not going to see you again, so let me tell you.
your father had a bad eye and was in trouble.
i said i'd buy you the next one for a high price to pay for the treatment.
i prepared a contract just because i was worried about verbal promise.
i'm just being careless.
i got the wrong piece of paper.
you wouldn't even notice him if he had bad eyesight.
the contract that i signed
i can't believe it was a big loan.
wait... dad, then "
what's the value of a lost eyesight painter?
i sent you to the other world because i feel sorry for you!
they're probably drawing some kind of angel nude right now!!
huh?
tsk tsk.
the window was taller than i thought...
hey...
what's with this guy?
shiora?!
no, no, no.
i'm sorry i'm late at night...
i'll take mrs. raine over here.
i came to pick you up, but...
ah, aniki!
this is the strange closed eyes i reported earlier!
what is it, bill?
did he follow you?
even if you try to poke me...
he's got... eyes.
smells good.
the delicious smell of renee's hamburger.
i followed that and came all this way...
it's filled with the smell of carrion.
i don't feel very good.
at this rate, dinner will get cold.
we don't have to pull our guns out.
please let me go peacefully.
......
bill.
oh, my god.
you idiot who can't see the situation at all
i'm going to have to use lead bullets to make it known.
you're the one who licked me like my eyes were closed.
shiora!!
fuck you.
i shot him.
that's the first thing.
bil!?
get ready for this shit.
don't let him get away!!
blast him!!
...!? i won't hit you!!
what the hell's going on?!
if you pull the trigger so roughly
i know exactly where it's coming from.
whoa!!
*hic*
this guy!
don't shut your eyes!!
her eyes are tied!!
binding eyes...?
no way...
i've heard...
there was a gunman who killed every mafia in the city for revenge...
the people in the city who were afraid of his power
he sewed his eyes open and he kicked him out of town.
that pathetic gunman...
they say he's still shooting villains like ghosts...
this guy...?
a shot in the eye with a binding.
you don't think this kid...
oh, my god.
which one of us is invisible?
you're underestimating me as a closed eye.
you idiots.
this guy's got a light...
just stay still, okay?
mr. raine.
we're done here.
it's the darkness of closing eyes.
*sigh*
*sigh*
*sigh*
*sigh*
i'm alive...
but...
just me?
are you hurt?
mr. raine.
yeah. yeah.
shit.
my...
my family.
how did this happen?
why...?
don't fuck with me...
then why?
dad's dead!!
w-wait.
don't shoot me.
die!
dieeeee!!
why... why?
why?!
shiola!!
this guy killed my father...
mr. raine.
if you pull the trigger
be prepared for anything.
damn it...
you're a lifesaver.
i'm shiora.
you want me to hire you.
now that's your price.
did you just say why "
and i said, why?
it's funny.
i can't believe i'm not prepared for that.
gedo (the outside world) or lower
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
damn it.
hmph.
in the dark.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
i told you, it's okay.
you didn't have to see me off.
you should at least thank him.
i did it on my own.
you're going to keep shooting...?
yeah...
by my eyes.
......
that's quite a load to see you off.
yeah. yeah.
i need to get out of town.
it's depressing to be here.
that's...
where the hell are you going...?
where you go.
you're happy about that, right?
no, no, no, no, no.
it's like you're living with your blood flowing.
if you're with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't think i can pull your hand.
you're not allowed to cook again, are you, sir?
but...
i knew it.
we miss each other.
to go on the road alone...
i don't know...
the train's leaving.
the wings of dreams...
it's waxed.
the higher you fly
it's going to melt into the sun.
- in that case,
it's better not to fly from the start.
one day, i'm sure.
you failed!!
manned rocket, asagao, exploded!
because it's going to fall to the ground.
japan's first manned space flight has failed!!
balloon dream
kuchitaka mitsuki
10 years later, in the summer...
aikawa hitoshi
you have the academic ability to be a first-class college student.
so why are you after a third-rate recommendation?
i don't have a dream.
a dream...? nonsense.
if there's an easy and safe path, we should choose it.
am i wrong?
good job, aikawa.
for a noncute student like you
it's easy to ask for things.
?
during your summer vacation.
you're going to help me with my astronomy club.
?
hey. hey.
why are you helping out with club activities that don't concern you?
well, listen.
i know you like to cross the stone bridge
you don't get torako if you don't get torako in the world.
that's what he wants to teach you.
so take care of the astronomy club while you're at the hot spring.
you just wanna take a trip!!
goddamn it!
why would i do this?
if you don't help me, i won't recommend it.
isn't that a threat?!
...tenmonbu.
it's here.
excuse me.
hm?
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
wh-what's this!?
... a balloon?
i'm sorry. it's messy right now.
oh, are you helping out?
welcome!
to the astronomy club full of dreams full of balloons!
change it!
i'm the director, sonoyama mizuki!
i heard from sensei. you're aikawasan, right?
please take good care of me this time.
no, it's okay.
likewise!?
what's with this guy?
is there no one else in the club!?
i'd like to get right to the point.
go home!
see ya!!
balloons.
lift the camera up into space!!
the camera?
balloons.
i saw it on tv before!
the balloon and the camera went into space...
the balloon broke and fell with a parachute...
when i recovered the camera, i was able to get a picture of earth!
isn't that exciting?
wha--
what's with that hoodlum teacher!?
she's pushing me into a troublesome situation...!!
?
and...
that's why there are a lot of balloons!
please let aikawasan swell up too!
you know what?
no matter how many balloons we gather, there's no way they'll float!!
ugh.
he's an idiot.
............?
what are you doing! what?
if you don't put in helium, the balloon won't float!!
why is it a disposable camera in the first place!
ah!
it was cheap.
are you going to roll the film around in space and snap the shutters!?
geez.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there are tons of photos of earth on the internet.
you didn't have to take it yourself...
yeah. yeah.
well, that's...
my dream.
is to become an astronaut and look at the round earth.
this is the first step towards a dream.
that's why i really want to take pictures of myself.
i can't believe i'm talking about dreams like that.
only people i've never dreamed of.
if you want to be an astronaut, you know that.
ten years ago.
the launch of japan's first manned rocket, asagao, failed.
i just put people on rockets for nothing.
risk and cost will go up.
a lot of people suffered from failure.
manned space flight.
it's a stupid thing to not think about the future.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to say this...
it's okay.
but to me
it's an important dream.
tsk, help me...
i'll help you out.
recommend...
i have to take it.
amazing~~~!!
the camera is really flying!!
i can't believe i'm going to be able to take a picture of earth now...!!
no, no, i can't.
i told you it's just a test shoot today.
is that so?!
just listen to what i have to say!
it's hard to fly high all of a sudden.
we need to get to the bottom of this.
the real thing is a big balloon that can withstand the loss of atmospheric pressure in the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters.
it's going to be swept away by the air currents.
i'm going to drop the gps and go look for it.
this time, pull an octopus string and collect it.
oh ... i see.
......
mr. aikawa
hm?
helping
really.
thank you. thank you.
......
i had no choice but to do it for the sake of my recommendation...!!
huh?
something like that.
it's a weird feeling.
aww.
this is...
the thread's broken...
there's nothing we can do about this...
what should i do?
we have to go after him.
no, it's okay.
it's a toy camera that costs 2,000 yen.
and around here, you're just gonna fall into the mountains or the fields.
it's more expensive to find.
no, sir.
because it's important...
something important to me.
...you.
did you get something for yourself?
i'm sorry! i absolutely want to go up into space!
it's very light.
but i'm sure they'll object!
of course it is!
i'm counting the weight!
you did that on your own...!!
aikawasan...
i...
i'm going to go look for him.
i've been listening for a while now.
you're always talking about the fluffy stuff.
i can't go out with you!!
you little balloon girl!!
after he's done, he's off to look for him "
it's really...
stupid guy.
......
what's your dream?
i'm home.
welcome back, father!
jin
you're still awake?
because my father hasn't come home at all...
you're working too hard.
really? well, can't be helped "
asagao is...
it's your father's dream.
she collapsed due to anxiety, and then...
even though he's in charge of the development of the rockets, he's still at the brink of criticism...
i didn't think you'd trip over japan's first launch.
that's the worst possible outcome.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i wish i hadn't.
huh...?
aikawasan?
are you still here?
sonoyama...?
you're soaking wet.
ehehe.
again today...
i couldn't find it.
?
whoa!!
you...
you're burning up!
don't look for me until this is over!
why would i do something like this...?!!
in the infirmary for now...
......
no. no.
it's not a waste...
whoa, whoa, whoa.
because...
my... my...
my...
it's a dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
mr. aikawa
i'm gonna throw up.
upuu
w-wait, sonoyamaaaaaa!!
huh?!
you wanna take it easy on the way home?!
i'm your advisor, so get your car out of here!!
geez.
for now, we'll secure the foot to the drop point.
it's about time to prepare for launch!
hey, don't be so tense!!
ugh ... i was sleeping with a cold and on the day of the launch
i couldn't find the prototype after all...
no matter what.
there was something in there that i wanted to put into space...
ora.
raise your head.
that's it, right?
what's important to you?
it was sold ten years ago.
aasagao's limited key ring
i've been wondering.
i don't know why you're so particular about it.
that's why i looked for you while you were asleep.
don't tell me you're taking pictures of the earth
i can't believe you're trying to hold a memorial service for your rocket.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh...
see?
i'll put it on you, so get ready!
for me, too.
it's important.
...one.
let me hear it.
if you have that key ring...
you saw it, too.
where asagao falls
why are you so calm?
i can say i want to be an astronaut.
asagao, the dream of many people
it was a wax-clad tama's wings.
you'd be worried if you saw that.
if we fail, we lose everything.
you're scared, you know...
like failure.
regret.
my wings...
i don't know what to do if it's a fake.
no, sir.
fake wings.
when i couldn't fly
what really hurts when the wings are broken
i'm sure of it.
because it's a real wing.
that pain is proof that he was struggling.
that's why i...
i don't regret it.
i'm not going to die.
there it is.
there it is!!
did it really go up into space?
what's going on?!
you don't believe me?
no! that's not what i mean...
well, that's...
you'll find out when you see what's inside.
tch, the earth was blue.
that's how it feels...
hah!
haha...
hahahahahahahahahahahaha.
whaaat?!
did i say something funny!?
no, i'm sorry.
no way, really.
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
um...
mr. aikawa
hm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i'm going to play with aikawasan.
i'm just being selfish...
thank you for letting me go all the way to the treasure...!!
it's really...
it's okay. it's okay.
i'm sure of it.
it's not a big deal.
compared to this view
i'm sure it's no big deal.
i'm not recommending it.
i'll study harder and make it.
a rocket that even an idiot like you can go into space.
it's me.
i'll make you something.
*hic*
what do you mean, idiots?!
hey, you!
you just said it yourself!
ugh...
i'm glad you're not in my neighborhood.
excuse me...
welcome.
i-it's medicine...
you're really at a loss!!!
what's wrong!? you have a stomach ache?
ugh...
when i eat the onigiri i picked up
onyaka...
it's edible...
here, i'll let you use the restroom. go get some rest, okay?
ojamas...
uh, uh...
the shop that i used to work at was destroyed by fire.
he was lost in the street, picked up and ate...
i'm sorry for the trouble.
no, no, no. that was a disaster.
you feel better now?
yeah!
oh yeah! i'll pay for the drink.
yeah, i don't need the money...
huh?
huh!?
it's too late...
uh...
...
why don't you work at my place?
are you sure?!
can prepare a bed and a meal, if that's all right "
that's more than enough.
the manager saved my life.
you're exaggerating, hahaha...
what's your name?
it's mel!
what am i supposed to do first?!
iih!!
yeah, i'm counting on you tomorrow.
yes, sir.
it's hot, so don't burn yourself.
ugh... tasty... tasty...
i'm glad i broke my stomach...
are you sure it's okay?
i wonder if it's okay.
thank you so much!
i'll do my best to be of service.
an alarm clock...

yes, sir.
good night.
whaaat?!
i see. an alarm clock...
what a ferocious volume...

we'll wake him up a little later.
ah.
good morning.
huh?!
it's too late!?
eh? but ...
i set it properly yesterday.

it sounded like shit.
i really didn't realize...

i'd like you to clean the fallen leaves.
leave it to me!
good morning.
oh, my god, are you helping?
yes! is grandma shopping?
you're doing well...

thank goodness...
thank goodness!!
i'll do my best from now on!
manager! is this my apron?!
yeah, i made some last night.
wow! there's a frog too!!
now i feel like a clerk.
i need you to do some shopping today.
here's your money and notes.
i put a little more money in it.
mel, go get something for yourself, okay?
tenchooo...
hahaha. i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome home.
ugh... sorry for asking too much of you...
heheh!
i bought you a souvenir.
heehee.
let's eat together later.
and, uh...
i want you to be healthy forever.
it's a charm.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.

heheh!
i'm looking forward to going shopping with the manager.
yeah, you're right.
for now, i need to buy mel's clothes.
yeah!
you know what?
i like my clothes bigger!
if it's bigger, you can wear it even if you get taller, right?
i... i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
um...
the peeling of the vegetables...
peeler?
yes, that's it!
i'm not good at using a kitchen knife.
i can skin peel them if i have peelers.
then help me cook more.
i'll be more useful to the manager!!
manager?!
do you soak the onions?
oh, yeah, onions...
he broke his stomach and went to the pharmacy
thank you. thank you.
it looks good on the manager.
your choice, huh?
this boy was hired on a whim.
he lost his job and a place to live in a fire.
the contents of the only backpack i had
that's all your stuff?
lann.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
but you still work with a smile every day.
i'm happy to buy a lot today.
manager!
look! look!
frog hat!
it's nice to look warm.
why don't you try it on?
heehee.
yeah, yeah, it suits you.
like a frog.
is it cool?!
eh!?
ah ... yeah yeah.
what do you mean cool "
oh, yeah, yeah.
isn't this great?
it's getting cold, so you need a coat, right?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
are you sure you want to wear something this formal...?
what are you talking about?
it's cold, isn't it?
the lining was also a quilt.
and...
isn't this a good one?
...it's a little girly, isn't it?
really? it's convenient to wear it right away.
it's okay if you get taller.
you're right, you're amazing.
or a sweater so it doesn't get cold...
can't i wear it now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
let's go to the cookware store next!
hattenchoo
uh, you want a peeler, don't you?
yes, sir.
since we're here, let's buy a cup of mel.
go look for it, okay?
yeah!
!!
disposal...?
it's a frog figurine.
you want it?
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
but...
buying it won't do you any good?
i'm sure he didn't need it, so he stayed.
is that so?
i thought i wanted it.
frog figurines bring good luck.
might be a good idea to hang it in the shop.
hey, manager.
mr. frog was depressed earlier.
you look happy now.
yeah, you're right.
maybe i'm glad i found a place to stay.
yes, sir.
it's just like me.
the same?
it's the same.
ohhh...
you look happy...
leave the skinning to me, mr. armstrong!
yeah, nice to meet you.
let's get some easy peeling vegetables...
you wanna practice cutting with a kitchen knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll tell you. why don't you give it a try?
well, then...
...
tenchoo...
i don't think i can...
i'm losing my fingers...
... first, the cat's hand.
a cat?
holding down the vegetables as if to hide the claws...
yeah, yeah, yeah.
the knife grips the blade from above
put the blade in your left hand.
i cut it like i'm pushing it in.
...i think i can do it...
yeah, yeah, yeah. keep it up.
itadakimasu
...
it's a big vegetable.
it's good to eat each other's food.
really?!
oh, it's really good...
it's much better than my food...
i'm...
the manager's dinner.
i think it's delicious every day!
ah.
thank you. thank you.
sekaiichi!!
that much!!
hahaha.
heehee.
it's warm.

okay. okay.
i'm off.

...
it's kind of cold...
snow...?
it's already this late...
it's a lot later than i expected.
mel... i'll eat dinner...
meh...!?
did you come to pick me up?!
bring the manager's umbrella.
*sniff*
thank you. thank you.
i'm worried, so please wait at home next time.
yeah...
where's my umbrella?
ah.
because i have a hat!
you forgot...
see?
stay out of my umbrella.
yes, sir.
...isn't it small?
not at all.
...
there's something good about being small.
i thought you'd just lost me.
did something happen?
yeah!
he's half-baked with the umbrella manager!
that's right.
i see... that's good.
aren't you cold?
yes, sir.
the manager's with me.
funeral girl.
people are not equal.
but...
[death] comes equally to everyone.
well, then.
farewell to the departed.
no, no, no.
no, no, no, no.
i didn't think you'd come this far.
ah!
that's mama from a snack bar on 1chome!
that's my favorite okami!
i'm still very popular, too!
i'm going to live!
the funeral parlor.
to create a place for the living and the dead.
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
i'm one of them.
he's dead, isn't he?
welcome to the phantom funeral parlor.
he's a human being who can see.
huh?
do you wear makeup for your late sister?
president of karasuma funeral company, cardinal karasuma, age 25
yes, sir.
funeral client sakurano suzume, 19 years old.
angel makeup.
that's what i mean.
i know it's impossible.
but i have to.
i want to do makeup on oneechan...
*sigh*
i'm not a professional yet, but...
it's a makeup egg from a vocational school!
i can do it properly! mr. karasuma
i think you should stop.
!
i've never met a living girlfriend
you must have had a beautiful face.
why!?
ms. sparrow.
i heard your sister was a famous beautiful actress.
the media is making a fuss every day.
i don't...
are you saying you don't have the ability to apply makeup on your sister?
haha. that's not it.
your face after the accident.
did you see that?
well, that's probably true.
no... no.
from the hospital.
he told me not to look too much...
right now, sakurano swallowsan
it's not the face you know.
car accident.
a frontal collision to the guardrail caused by speeding over.
his face was torn to shreds by a broken windshield.
broken bones are breaking through the skin.
there is a simple procedure in the hospital
no one will notice you're alive.
when i looked at you, i said, i can't do it.
then it's a problem.
......i...
what do you think?
but even so
are you prepared to face your sister now?
hey, funeral parlor!
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
please don't tease me like that!!
she's my little sister!
swallow.
you asked me to do it.
isn't that obvious?
i don't want her to see me like that!
i'm used to being hated by other people.
but i don't want my sister to pull me in.
i wonder if that's the case...
don't make ms. sparrow do her makeup.
oh "
but why don't you think about suzumesan's feelings too?
it's just the two of us.
...to you.
what do you know about it?
anyway!
i won't admit it!!
give me another agent!
and...
and?
...it's nothing!!
......anyone......
the goodbyes are full of regrets
it's lonely, isn't it?
have a good day!
traffic accident death of a beautiful actress, sakurano swallow.
there are a lot of rumors going around in the world
what do you think, everyone?
there are also rumors that he was killed by someone.
she was one of the weirdest people in the entertainment world.
what does that mean?
well, like a pillow or a rookie pickled vegetables.
it's just a rumor.
you're not as sensitive as i thought you'd be.
i know your face and acting skills, but
it's......right?
- we'll continue.
the truth of sakurano tsubame's death.
ah!
i was watching.
sparrow!
take this to table four!
sorry to keep you waiting!
yes, sir.
...wait.
huh?
funeral parlor?
doumo
the ramen was delicious.
right? right?
it's our pride and joy!
you go to a vocational school while earning your own money.
i need money to go to school too! i can't take a day off!
i don't want to burden my sister as much as possible...
...
ah...
!
shall we go?
eh?
where!?
where is your sister now?
this is...
a ghost.
we know where he is.
the first is where he died.
the second is where the remains are buried.
and thirdly
beside the person dear to me.
you know what?
i'm actually here.
oneesan.
haha.
are funeral parlors joking?
please call me kururu.
mr. privy...
ha.
don't you feel bad about your sister?
there's a lot of rumors going around...
rumors are rumors, right?
you just have to ask him the truth.
a cardinal is interesting.
...me too.
i was in the car until just a moment ago.
in my sister's car that had an accident
on the way home from work
the weather forecast says it'll be cloudy and then it'll rain heavily...
i'm busy with work, too.
he said, it's my birthday so let's go eat somewhere.
he came to pick me up.
but i got into a fight with oneechan.
uh... about the school fees.
i wanted to go to school with the money i saved up.
but...
i didn't hear that oneechan was going to pay for everything.
my parents died.
to oneechan who acted as a parent
i didn't want to cause any more trouble...
you're still a child.
that's what they say.
it pisses me off.
hey! sparrow!
i jumped out of the car.
i hate you!
oneechan...
that's...
that was the last thing i said to oneechan.
oneechan's accident
was caused by excessive speed, right?
i think he was probably chasing me.
after i left the car and ran
it's raining hard.
my dream is...
it was to be in charge of makeup for oneechan on stage.
but...
i can't do it anymore.
because of me.
because of me...
oneechan is dead.
until the end.
i caused trouble for oneechan...
i don't care if it's annoying or not.
it's not something you can decide for yourself.
what about it, actually?
swallow.
did i bother you?
...?
if you think i'm bothering you "
i won't be by your side "
you're the one who should know better than anyone, right "
that's what he said.
...it's strange.
i saw oneechan for a moment.
mr. privy...
may i ask you again?
if you are prepared to accept all of my sister
it's done.
hey~
can i open my eyes now?
yeah!
today's makeup...
i'm sure of it!
*snore*
ahaha!
shitty!
even though i worked hard...
i still have a long way to go before i can become my own makeup.
can i become one too?!
oneechan, you're in charge of makeup!
hey. hey.
life isn't that easy.
when you can make makeup that will satisfy me
i can think about it.
i'll give you a reward when the time comes.
really!?
that's why, at best
brush your arms!
swallow.
it was beautiful.
......i'm always beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
i wasn't by suzumesan's side either.
of course it is!
i didn't want her to see me like that.
you never wanted to fulfill my request from the start.
it wasn't there.
if it's your real request,
i made it come true.
huh...?
mr. privy.
thank you so much!
thanks to you
i can send oneechan without regrets.
um...
this one.
i borrowed your makeup brush.
i'll give it back to you.
!
that's...
this belongs to you, ms. sparrow.
?
onee-chan...
gah...?
this is the birthday present i was going to give you.
the swallow.
i'm sure he was going to give it to you when we were having dinner.
they found him outside the car.
as a memento of your sister.
even though you were in an accident
it was miraculously unharmed.
i'm sure of it.
your sister was protecting you.
......i'm not going to thank you.
you're stubborn, aren't you?
you're in big trouble!
yeah, yeah, yeah.
......why?
it's a pain, isn't it?
you do this kind of work.
every day, i would watch someone cry
i don't know how to say condolences to strangers.
...that's not true.
you're...
you can smile, right?
...really.
seduce funeral parlor.
...thanks.
the sound of civilization and enlightenment
when the curtains of darkness are paid
evil rasetsu never ceases.
no. no.
the more people's lights cover the world
the delusions of evil spirits spread throughout the world.
kureha
...
...goi.
to do that.
our rakshasa hunt
rasetsu hunter-and-punitive officer
aritou hiroya
i'm going to recommend it.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
kuchitaka mitsuki
it seems that arifuji did it alone again
the demon's shouki drifting around
what a grudge.
you were a very powerful demon.
but...
as expected of rasetsu hunting from the great onmyoji family.
i can't believe that giant demon was burned to the ground.
it's as strong as a demon god.
hey, if you say kishin to yourself, you'll be killed.
since my family was devoured by demons
i'm a real demon-hat.
but it's not a mistake.
that eye...
there's definitely a demon nesting in his heart.
if the demon's nesting in my heart...
that's--
stop it! stop it!
it must have been that day.
let go of the chords!!
nii...
sama...
no, don't...
please don't...
ah...
ugh...
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
how dare you?
how dare you...
i'll take care of my father.
i'll take care of my mother.
a chord...!!
let's not do this.
grave visit like this
kureha.
such an offering...
every time i defeat a demon,
to offer a finger to the grave...!!
...
it's for my family.
look in front of his grave, full of curiosity.
this is for me...?!
do you think your parents and your sister will feel at ease?!
kureha
i am grateful to you for serving the family head of arito for generations as a shikigami.
but...
revenge service for these wounds and the vows made to the deceased family
you can't stop him.
i don't know how it hurts.
you don't have to.
you're gonna tell me...
even i...
i hate evil demons.
that i was caught off guard that day and couldn't protect you.
i still feel like i'm burning with regret.
but...
i'm more worried than that.
hiroya
your eyes are getting cloudy.
hey, hiroya!
message!
message!
what's the matter?
the demon outbreak is spreading!
we need backup immediately!!
understood.
we're on our way.
ugh...
nao nao--
the target was identified as a demon who attacked the capital ten years ago.
subject: oni-go
kakyoumaru
maru...
mirror... mirror...
ah, hiroya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's a big deal.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i will fulfill my wish.
like an ogre.
bah!
stupid...
one or two elite punitives...
that's annihilation...?
y-you bastard!
you freak!!
if you come to the capital for the first time in a long time
it's almost like it's not crunchy.
that's all you can eat.
*hic*
oh?
only leftovers.
*hic*
people around here.
i've devoured them all.
your family is in my belly.
you don't like me?
hate me, hate me.
hatred is what makes me the most happy.
- ta-ta.
help me...
hmph.
it's a wake up call.
what bastard?!
rasetsu hunter-and-punitive officer
aritou hiroya
you've been avenging my family for ten years.
i'll send you to hell.
kakyomaru!!
arifuji...?
you...
that arifuji!!
ten years ago, the child i left behind
it looked like it was going to be delicious.
i'm so happy, i can't stop drool.
arifuji...
kureha
goi
ugh!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?
goyo no 'gokuen' (the extreme flame) that he wore to bury you.
that pain won't go away easily.
these wounds were carved ten years ago.
until this throbbing subsides.
enjoy to your heart's content!!
hiroya, you're too excited. calm down a little.
he's a cunning wraith who surprised me and your father ten years ago.
be careful!
one by one!?
don't worry about it.
ten years of anger.
it's not that easy.
ugh...
*ka-ka-ka*
*crack*
well done...
well done. here we go.
i grew hatred.
it was worth the spitting back then.
this is the first time i've ever had such a mature hatred.
it's just the best ingredients.
arifuji...
i want to eat you the best way i can.
hmph.
that wish.
know that it will never come true!
so, in that case
what do you think of this?
nii-sama...
genjutsu is bad... for my sister!
hiroya!!
you're playing with me.
to such a delusion
my sword will not dull now.
even though it's a genjutsu, her face...
amazing will...!
but...
there's no need to hesitate!!
kihi.
kihihi
alright, arifuji.
it's the best!!
your obsession.
looks like it's the best!!
this is not a delusion!
this is gi!
it's about family!!
which words do you speak of family love?
there's someone who can cut my sister's figure up here.
arifuji
look at that.
just look at me.
your obsession.
show me everything you've got.
ugh.
oh...
oooooooooooooooooooooo!!
hiroya
what the hell is going on!?
this is...
shoki is inhaled by an old wound!?
i'll take care of arifuji.
i want to eat it the best way i can.
you...
you're going to turn hiroya into a demon!!
kakyo-maru!!
passion takes the heat most when people are swallowed up by it.
hiroya, listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me and the delusions of vengeance rule you--
you will become a demon and become one with me, arifuji!!
hang in there, hiroya!
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
come on. come on.
the next one.
with the next sword...
you're a delusion.
i'll eat you!!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...
ugh...
ah!
give it to me.
hah...
ah...
aaah!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!
it's a wake up call.
the shikigami-like atmosphere makes you struggle.
did you take care of yourself and distract your master from me?
well, whatever...
get your ass down.
rasetsugari
ten years ago, i was cursed.
it's not going to be that easy.
father.
hahakami
a chord...
what's the matter?
wearing a demon's mask.
take that.
come on, look at me.
n... n...
y-you're...
oni... kill you!
- what?!
s-stop it!
hah...
2n,
se...
no, no, no...
she swallowed me up.
knock.
no.
fool!!
gah...ah!?
i got caught in a stupid curse.
are you still the legitimate son of the arito family?!
stupid.
why are you the one who was killed?!
...
haha.
why? i'm asking a strange question.
- what!?
to the danger of the lord.
can you sleep with a single sword?
the wound.
burned?!
i'm aware of that.
well...
it was a bit much, though.
ugh... i'm...
he's starting to come around.
you...
like a shikigami.
how dare you interfere with kakyo-maru, who has lived for a hundred years?!
i can't believe i'm the only one
a hundred years?
don't get carried away in a hundred years, kakyomaru.
it's been a thousand years since i've been a shikigami since the peaceful world.
even if i'm inferior to you in strength.
this love.
i will not lose to delusions.
a delusion covers all feelings.
don't get swallowed up by something like that.
look at me.
feel me.
the smell carved into you reminds you of your family.
don't forget yume yume.
the feelings that were in your heart
and then...
that i'm always with you.
this is bullshit...
i won't forgive you.
such a farce.
- what!?
kakyoumaru
i'm sorry, but...
from here on out
you're alone in a sumo tournament.
i'm sorry, goha.
my wound... it hurts.
don't prove it.
i don't train in such a soft way that i can't stand here.
if that's the case...
come on, man.
h-hey, wait, wait.
what are you going to do?
no way!
goi
don't do that!
ugh...
whaaaaaat?!
uh...
the curse.
sakaiki
my obsession burns...
it's a waste.
it's such a waste.
it's a waste, a waste, a waste...
youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!
i wish you the best of luck with this inexorable hatred.
the ultimate delusion
the taste of what you've wasted.
tokuto
taste it!!
if it tastes like a delusion
i already know.
forgetting the pain and getting intoxicated by hatred
it was sweet, kagamimaru.
but...
don't do this anymore.
i'm done.
i won't lose sight of it.
kureha
...what is it?
it's heavy.
that's because you're so lacking in words!!
the burn on my arm hurts, and i'm exhausted.
at least turn me into a spirit...
hmph.
this is punishment.
punishment for pointing your blade at me.
i'll do this to your house.
i'm gonna have to take my ass off for a while.
kureha...
i'm weak.
when he killed kakyomaru, he showed his face.
i don't know when i'll lose sight of myself again and hurt you.
i don't know what to do anymore.
i'm not qualified to handle you.
tawake
i'm aware of the child's weakness now.
you may be off the road on a moonless night.
i'm here for that.
from the time of peace, he served arifuji.
hayachinen
a thousand years ago
your trial is about to start!
i see...
i can't do this.
okay, now.
well, we're going to clean the grave tomorrow!
h-hey.
don't run so fast!
