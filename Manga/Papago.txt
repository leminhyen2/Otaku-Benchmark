bound-eye siola
decaying falconry
that's why
you're saying you don't know.
i can't believe i owe you such a debt!
i don's not
lane...
i have an iou over here.
i have to pay back the money i borrowed from tortiano.
i don't know.
i can't believe my father borrowed money from the casino.
oh my gosh!
maybe it's from the tortiano family.
what?
i'm taking it in. start over!
oh, my gosh...
please wait for me.
ah
with a thud
oh my gosh...!
i'm sorry... i couldn't help falling down with something blind.
what do you want from the mafia?
well, let's see...
my name is siola, and i'm a sink gunman.
i heard the name of the tortillas who ruled this area.
i was wondering if you could hire me as a bodyguard.
i'm blind. i can't see.
gunman...?
oh, my god...
don't lick the mafia, either.
ah
is your closed eyes a guard?
why don't you throw away the brains that were shot in the waist?
what?
oh, you know...
don't do that for a place like this!
...
huh?
are you by any chance?
is it a woman?
yes... but...
oh!
show me your face.
eh
even if you close your eyes, if you're handsome, you'll be able to trade.
hey, hey...!
what!?
what's wrong with you?
oh my gosh...
?
how can you show me!
that's terrible!
are you all right?
i'll go home today.
but don't think you'll ever be able to do this forever.
lane
stupid
anta is...
buy a gun for the tortillars, who grew up in a shooting?
i can't believe you're fighting bill tortilla.
he's one of the tortillars. he's the roughest man in the city.
i see.
the seven-foot giant is the younger brother of the mafia brothers.
that's right!
i'm sorry. i won't tell you, so i'm going to
...huh? that's about the height.
how do you know exactly when you're blind...?
you can tell by the direction of your voice and the weight of your footsteps.
you weigh a little more than five or seven feet, and three sizes...
oh my gosh!
don't you understand that much?
i'm kidding.
...i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
hahaha
well, i'm going to...
i have to find a place to stay tonight.
oh my gosh!
...
oh my gosh!
thank you for your trouble.
i'll do something about that dirty outfit first.
around the corners of one's eye
if you don't want to see it, wrap it up with a towel.
oh, thank you very much.
i'll wash it for you.
you don't know what to do in a shower at someone's house, do you?
...you know what?
you're quite used to dealing with closed eyes.
oh, my god.
my father had bad eyes, too.
no, i don'
it's getting worse, to be exact.
he's a terrible father. he's a poor painter.
i only drew women's nudity to make money and wholesale it to tortilla.
but my eyes are getting worse and worse because i'm sick."
you must have been shocked in your own way.
have you lost your job and lost your money?
you're trying to model me.
in the end, he gambled his debts into the river.
you're a terrible father, aren't you?
in the end...
lane, are you a model?
i'm sorry.
because it was persistent.
it wouldn't have been much money for me to draw, but...
yes, sir.
i'm glad to hear that.
you must have been happy.
i was able to draw your daughter before she lost her sight.
mr. lane?
it's nothing.
i'm done with my back is over.
look, it's this way.
what about you, anta?
why are you traveling with a gun?
even those eyes...
it's not a big deal.
i shot the mafia who killed my parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown because of that.
these eyes...
i'll give you proof of my crime.
...
my eyes were closed...?
it's terrible...
you just avenged your parents!
there's nothing wrong with it, mr. lane.
it's not as tragic as your father's.
i'm the one who wants blood. i'm the one who wants blood.
i can't complain about what he did.
why don't you throw away your gun?
even if that's the case!
even though
then...
throw it away?
it's no longer
i only have guns and closed eyes.
get dinner ready
call me if you have any inconvenience.
i'm sure it's a lie.
a lie that beggars tell to attract attention
that's what i'm supposed to do.
!
are you up yet?
i've just made it here.
please show me to my seat now.
ー ‼
lane, i just got up.
oh, it smells good.
it smells like hamburgers.
huh?
mr. lane
damn it
let go of me!
what's wrong with you all of a sudden?
don't shout like that, lane.
i think my brother told me a lot about the matter.
that doesn't mean you're going to be this far.
don tortilla!
oh my gosh!
can't you manage that manly personality?
i don's well
that's why you got a buyer.
buyer...?
i'd like you better if you bought your father's painting.
i really want to buy you as a model.
be happy, lane
if the buyer arrives in a few hours, he'll be in debt.
most
i don't know how you'll be treated at the destination.
whizzing
don't be silly!
who is it?
wheezing
it's no use, lane.
no one will come even if you shout in a warehouse out of town like this.
absolutely
no matter what you do, you can't complain.
if your father doesn't have eyes, he'll save you.
well...
what do you mean...
i won't see you again, so i'll tell you.
your father's eyes hurt. he's in trouble.
i said i'd buy you the next painting at a high price for the treatment.
you must be worried if you just make a verbal promise, so i prepared a contract.
i'm just careless, too.
i made a slight mistake in the paper.
i can't believe i'm blind. i can't even notice him.
the contract i signed...
i can't believe it was a big loan.
wait a minute. dad's gonna...
what's the value of a painter who lost his eyesight?
i felt sorry for you, so i sent you to the afterlife!
you'll be drawing an angel's nude by now!
what?
with a thud
the window was higher than i thought...
hey...
what's wrong with him?
shiora!?
oh my gosh!
i'm sorry to be late at night...
i'm going to talk to mr. lane over here.
i came to pick you up, but...
oh, brother!
this is the strange closed eye i just reported!
what's wrong with bill?
did you turn it on?
he said he was going to stick to it.
this guy's got eyes.
it's the smell.
the delicious smell of hamburgers made by rene.
if you follow it all the way here...
it smells like rotten meat.
feel very sick
if things go on like this, dinner will cool down.
we don't have to pull out our guns.
would you please put me back in peace?
......
building
oops!
if you don't see the situation at all, you at all,
i'll have to tell you with a lead bullet.
i licked it like a closed eye.
shiora!
go to hell
i shot him.
that's the first one.
bill!?
come on, man!
never let it go!
kill me!
...!? i can't get it right!
what's going to happen!
don't pull the trigger so violently.
i don't know where they're coming from.
oh my gosh!
sound of something being used as a result of something being done
dude
it's not closed eyes!
it's binding eyes!
binding eyes...?
i don'tell me.
i've heard of it.
there was a gunman who killed all the mafia in a city out of revenge.
people in the city are afraid of his power.
i sewed my eyes and eyelids and kicked him out of town.
the poor gunman...
he's still shooting at bad guys like ghosts.
is this him...?
a bound-eyed shooter
i don't think there's a kid like this...
absolutely
which one is invisible?
look down on someone as a blindfold
geeks
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
please stay still.
leneic acid
this place is already...
it's dark in the dark.
ha
ha
ha
ha
i'm alive...
but
am i the only one?
are you hurt?
leneic acid
ah
damn it
mine
my family...
why are you doing this?
why...?
don't be silly.
then why?
my father is dead!
wait a minute.
don't shoot me.
death!
don't die!
why are you'really...
what's wrong with you?
shiora!
this guy's gonna take care of him.
leneic acid
if you pull the trigger
be sure to be prepared.
oh, my god.
i'm saved.
it's like shiora.
you want us to hire you, don't you?
now, at your asking price...
why did you just say that?
then he said, "why?"
comical
i can't believe i'm not that prepared.
subterritorial

damn it!
sentence
in the dark
keep regretting it for the rest of your life.
i told you it's okay.
i can't believe i went out of my way to see you off.
you have to thank me, don'
i did it on my own.
are you going to continue... shooting?
yes, sir.
in one's eyes
......
it's a lot of luggage to see you off.
ah
i'm leaving town, too.
because i'm depressed even if i stay here.
that's...
where the hell are you going...?
where you're going
you're happy, aren't you?
you can't do it.
it's like living with blood.
if you're with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to anta a long time ago.
i don't think i can back off from you.
you're allowed to cook for your benefactor again, aren't you?
but...
after all
we're both lonely, aren't we?
it's hard to go alone.
come on...
the train is leaving.
the wings of a dream are...
be solidified with wax
the higher one flies
be dissolved in the sun
- then...
you had better not fly from the beginning.
one day without fail
it's a failure!
manned rocket asagao explodes!
it's going to fall to the ground.
japan's first manned space flight failed!
balloon dream
decaying falconry
ten years later - summer
hitoshi aikawa
you have the ability to go to a top university.
so why are you aiming for a third-rate recommendation?
have no dream at all
dream...? it's silly.
if there's an easy and safe way, you should choose that way.
am i wrong?
all right, aikawa...
for a student like you who's not cute,
it's easy to order a lot of things.
?
during the summer vacation,
get help from our astronomy department
?
a little
why are you helping me with club activities that don't matter?
listen to me.
i know you like to cross the stone bridge.
if you don't go into a tiger's den, you won't get a tiger's nest.
the teacher wants to teach you that.
so i'll ask the astronomy department while the teacher goes to the hot spring.
you're just traveling, aren't you?
let's do it.
why am i doing this?
if you don't help me, i won't recommend it.
that power harassment teacher!
...the astronomical department.
here or here?
excuse me
huh?
oh my gosh!?
what's this!?
balloon?
i'm sorry, it's a mess right now.
oh, are you by any chance a helper?
welcome!
to the astronomical club full of balloons and dreams!
nice to meet you again!
i'm mizuki sonoyama, the manager!
you're mr. aikawa, aren't you?
i look forward to working with you this time.
one's home
hello!?
what's wrong with him?
are there any other club members!?
i'd like to get down to business right away.
on the way home.
ta-da!
in a ballooned
raise the camera into space!
camera?
in a ballooned
i saw it on tv before!
the balloon flew into space with the camera flew into space.
the balloon burst and fell off with a parachute.
i collected the camera and found a picture of the earth!
right? aren't you really excited?
oh my gosh!
what kind of help is that boncla teacher!
it's troublesome. he's forcing me...!!
?
and...
that's why there are so many balloons.
mr. aikawa, please inflate it a lot!
you know what?
but no matter how many inflatable balloons you collect, it won't float!
humming
he's absolutely stupid.
.......?
what are you stunned!?
if you don't put helium in, the balloon won't float!
why is it a disposable camera?
ah
because it's cheap...
are you going to wind up the film in space and turn off the shutter!?
absolutely
it may be possible in principle, but...
there are so many pictures of the earth on the internet.
i didn't bother to take a picture myself.
ah
that's...
my dream is...
because it's about becoming an astronaut and seeing a round earth.
this is the first step toward dreams.
that's why i really want to take pictures myself."
it's hard to talk about dreams like that.
i've never had a dream before. it's just a guy.
if you're aiming for an astronaut, you know that.
ten years ago.
japan's first manned rocket, asagao, failed to launch
it's not worth a lot of money. it's just a rocket.
increase both risk and cost
i failed and many people suffered.
manned space flight.
i don't know what to do. it's a fool's job.
swissman
i don't mean to say this.
that's all right.
but for me,
it's an important dream.
i don't know what to do.
i'll help you properly.
recommended...
i have to take it off.
wow~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!
the camera is really flying!
i can't believe i can take pictures of the earth with this......!!
no, no, i can't take a picture.
i told you it was just a test shoot today.
really!?
listen carefully!
it's hard to fly high all of a sudden.
first of all, i have to get a feel for it.
it's a 30,000-meter stratosphere with large balloons that can withstand pressure reduction.
it's going to be swept away by the airflow.
go over gps to find the drop site
this time, in a little while, pull the octopus thread and collect it.
oh... i see.
......
mr. aikawa
huh?
maid
truly
thank you very much.
......
i have no choice but to recommend...!!
huh?
something
it's a strange response...
oh my gosh!
this is...
i don't know if the thread's broken.
i don't know what to do with this...
what should i do
i have to go after him.
no, it's okay. it's okay.
it's a 2,000-yen toy camera.
and around here, you'll just fall into the mountains or fields.
be more expensive to look for
i can't do it.
because it's important...
what's important to me.
...you
did you put something in on your own?
i'm sorry! i really want to put it in space.
it's very light.
but i'm sure they'll object.
of course!
i'm calculating the weight properly!
you can do that on your own...!!
mr. aikawa...
me
i'm going to look for it.
if you keep asking
he's always saying fluffy things.
can you go out with me?
you balloon girl!
after the work, i'm going to look for it...
it'sir.
a stupid fellow
......
what's your dream?
i'm home
welcome back, dad!
kindness
were you still awake?
because my dad's not coming back at all.
you're working too hard.
really? well, it can't be helped.
"asagao" is...
it's my father's dream.
i fell down in agony and just...
even though i'm in charge of rocket development, i don't think i've been blamed that much.
i can't believe i tripped on the first launch in japan.
that's the worst ending.
i'm sure it's in the afterlife.
i wish i hadn't done it.
that's...
mr. aikawa?
is there still any left?
sonoyama...?
you're wet to the skin.
hehe
today, too...
i couldn't find it.
?
hey!
you
what a fever!?
don't look for it until this happens!
why are you doing such a useless thing...!!
first of all, i'm going to the nurse's office.
......
wrong
it's not like it's useless...
oh my geez!
because
mine
my...
it's a dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry.
mr. aikawa
i feel like throwing up.
whoop
wait a minute, sonoyama!
huh!?
i want to relax on my way home from my trip!?
i'm an adviser, so take out the car!
absolutely
first of all, i'll make sure i get to the drop point.
it's about time we got ready for the launch.
that's low tension!
ugh... i was lying down with a cold, and before i knew it, on the day of the launch,
i couldn't find the prototype after all...
no matter what
there's something i want to put in space.
oh my gosh!
look up!
that's it, isn't it?
the important thing you put in.
it was sold ten years ago.
limited edition key chain of asagao
i was curious.
i don't know what you're so particular about.
that's why i found you while you were sleeping.
i can't believe i took a picture of the earth.
i can't believe i'm trying to get a rocket.
oh, my gosh...
look!
i'll put it on, so i'll get ready right away!
even for me...
it's important.
...one.
let me hear it.
if you have that key ring,
you've been watching, haven't you?
a place where morning glory falls
why are you so calm?
i can say i want to be an astronaut.
"asagao," which was a dream of many people,
it was an imitation wing made of wax.
you'll be worried if you see that.
if you fail, you'll lose everything.
you're scared, aren't you?
like frustration.
regret or something like that.
my wings...
what if it's fake?
i don't have any.
i can't believe it's a fake wing.
when someone can't fly
what really hurts when you break your wings is...
i'm sure that's it.
it's a real wing.
it's a sign that the pain was fluttering.
that's why i...
i can't believe i regret it.
i won't die.
there it is...
there was one!
is it really up to space?
what's wrong with you?
are you suspicious?
no! that's not the case...
well, that's not true.
if you check the contents, you'll find out.
the earth was blue.
it's like...
wheezing
haha...
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
uh-huh!
did i say something wrong!?
no, suman.
i can't believe it.
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
hey!
mr. aikawa
huh?
thank you very much
i'm a fool, so i'll give aikawa a piggyback ride.
it's just selfish...
please even put on the treasure...!!
it'sir.
it's okay. it's okay.
surely
it's nothing special.
because compared to this view,
i'm sure it's nothing special.
i'll stop recommending it
i'll study harder and make it for you.
even a fool like you can go into space.
i...
i'll make it for you.
sound of something being used as a result of something being done
what are people called idiots?
you
you said it yourself earlier!
whoa, whoa...
i'm glad it's not my neighborhood.
i'm sorry...
come on in.
oh... i don't want any medicine...
it's really urgent!!
what!? does your stomach hurt?
uh-huh...
onigiri i picked up... if you eat it,
oh my gosh...
it's food poisoning...
look, i'll lend you the bathroom, so why don't you rest?
i'm sorry to interrupt you...
let's see...
the shop i worked at was destroyed by a fire.
i lost myself on the street and picked up food.
i'm sorry for the inconvenience.
no, no, no, no, no, no, it's a disaster.
are you feeling any better?
yeah!
oh, yeah! i'll pay for the drink.
yeah, i don't need any money.
huh?
huh!?
i don't have a wallet...
ah...
...
if you don't have a place to go, do you want to work at home?
is that okay!?
i wonder if i can prepare a meal and a bed...if that's all right with you,
that's more than enough.
the manager saved my life.
you're exaggerating, aren't you?
what's your name?
it's e-mail!
what should i help you first?
oh my geez!
yes, please take care of me from tomorrow.
yes, sir.
it's hot, so don't get burned.
wow... it's delicious... it's delicious...
i'm glad i got hungry...
did you like it?
...i wonder if it's good.
thank you very much!
i'll do my best to help you a lot.
let's see. the alarm clock...
do you like frogs?
yup.
good night
what!?
i see. the alarm clock...
what a terrible volume!
how can i sleep with this sound?
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
...
maybe i was tired.
i'll wake you up a little later.
ah
good morning
up?!
it's already this late!?
huh? but...
i set it up well yesterday.
is it broken...?
it was ringing like crazy.
i really didn't notice...
well then
shall i ask you to clean the fallen leaves?
leave it to me!
good morning
oh, my god. can i help you?
yeah! grandma, are you shopping?
you're doing well...
if you don't mind, stop by.
come on in.
come on in.
come on in.
this is...
do you think it will attract customers?
let me clean it up when there's a lot of people...
come back again!
a few days later
manager!
yes, sir.
manager, you like sweet things, don't you?
my grandmother told me to go to the manager too!
no, i'm sorry...
yes, the number of customers has increased a little since mel came.
really!?
it's helpful to me!?
of course
i'm glad...
i'm glad!
i'll continue to do my best!
manager! is this my apron?!
yeah, i made it last night.
wow! there's a frog, too!
i wonder if this has made me look like a clerk.
i'd like to ask you to do some shopping today.
yes, money and notes.
i put in a little more money.
why don't you buy something for me, too?
oh my gosh...
haha, i asked for it.
i'll be back!
i'm home
welcome back
no... i'm sorry i ordered too much.
all right!
i bought some souvenirs.
puffing
let's eat together later.
and...
i want the manager to stay healthy.
it's a charm.

thank you.
...by the way
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for eating together, right?
hahaha
shall we go buy something for e-mail next time?
yeah!
....
isn't it cold?
all right!
i'm looking forward to going shopping with the manager.
that's right.
first of all, i have to buy mel's clothes.
yeah!
you know what?
i wish my clothes were big!
if it's big, you can wear it even if you grow taller, right?
well... i see...
i wonder if it will grow...
is there anything else you want?
well...
peeling vegetables...
peeler?
that's right!
i'm not good at using knives.
if you have a peeler, you can peel it off.
then i'll help you cook more.
i'll be more helpful to the manager!
manager!?
does it sting onions?
yeah, onions...
i had an upset stomach and ran into the pharmacy.
thanks
look good on the manager
is it your choice?
this boy was hired by chance.
i think i lost my job and my place of residence in the fire.
the contents of the only backpack i had.
is that all your luggage?
orchid
just a little clothes and an alarm clock.
but he still works with a smile every day.
i was happy to shop a lot today.
manager!
take a look!
it's a frog hat!
it looks warm, doesn't it?
why don't you wear it?
puffing
yeah, it looks good on you.
do i look like a frog?
cool?!
what!?
oh... yeah, that's right.
what is cool...?
yeah, yeah.
isn't this good?
it's getting cold, so you need a coat, right?

do you like such proper clothes...?
what are you talking about?
it's cold if you don't do it properly, right?
is the lining quilted?
and...
isn't this good, too?
...isn't it a bit girlish?
really? it's convenient to wear right away.
it's okay to grow taller.
that's true. that's amazing.
or sweaters so that it's not cold.
can't i wear it now?
i'll cut the price tag.
i'm sorry.
let's go to the cooking utensils store next time.
good-for-nothing
well, you want a peeler, right?
yup.
shall we buy a bowl of dashi mel?
are you looking for it?
yup!
!!
disposal...?
it's a frog ornament, isn't it?
do you want it?

...but...
it's no use buying it.
i'm sure you don't need it, so it's left.
is that so?
i thought i wanted it.
frog figurines are good luck.
maybe there's something good to decorate the store.
hey, manager.
frog, you were depressed earlier.
you look kind of happy now.
that's right.
maybe you're happy to have a place.
yup.
be the same as me
is it the same?
the same as luckily
oh, my god.
you look happy...
leave the peeling of the manager to me!
oh, nice to meet you.
let's buy peeling vegetables...
do you want to practice cutting with a knife?
i wonder if i can do it.
i'll tell you, so why don't you try it for now?
well, then...
....
oh my gosh...
i don't think i can do it...
my fingers are gone...
first of all, it's a cat's hand.
cat?
hold down the vegetables like you're hiding your nails.
yes yes
hold the knife like you're holding the blade from above.
put the blade on your left hand.
cut back
i'm starting to feel like i can...
that's right. that's right.
let us eat
....
vegetables are big, aren't they?
it's good to eat enough, isn't it?
really?!
oh, you're really good...
it's much better than my food.
i'm...
manager's meal
i think it's delicious every day!
ah
thank you.
the best in the world!
that's it!
hahaha
puffing
it's warm, isn't it?
that's right.
ah
...what?
change of air

i can't believe you're older than me.
that's the case
it was the last word i said to my sister.
an accident with one's accident

it's raining a lot.
my dream is...

but
it's no longer true.
because of me
because of me...

"i won't do it because i'm by your side."
"my sister anta knows best, doesn't she?"
