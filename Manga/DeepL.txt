shiora the binding eye
mitsuki kutataka
i told you!
i told you i don't know!
you don't owe me that much money!
even so...
renai...
i have an iou here.
i owe tortillano money and he has to pay it back.
i don't care.
i don't care about the money my father borrowed from the casino...
excuse me...
are you from the tortillano family?
what?
i'm in the middle of something.
oh, uh...
please wait!
ah!
gah!
you bastard...!
i'm sorry... i'm blind and have "closed eyes", so i just fell down.
what does a closed-eye want with the mafia?
well...
my name is xiora, i'm a drifter gunfighter.
i heard the name of the tortillas who run this area.
i heard the name of the tortillas, who run this area, and i was wondering if i could hire you as a bodyguard...
a blind, closed-eyed...
gunman...?
oh...
don't you ever underestimate the mafia.
ah...
closed-eyed bouncer?
do you want me to shoot you in the brain with the gun on my hip?
what?
hey, uh...
don't do that! not here!
uh...
hmm?
are you...
a girl?
yes... yes, but...
huh?
let me see your face.
what?
even with closed eyes, if you're good enough...
what the hell...!
what's this?
what the hell...
what the hell...?
what the hell is this?
how dare you show me this!
that's terrible!
are you okay, you guys?
i'm leaving today.
but don't think you can stay here forever.
renai.
you idiot!
you...
you want me to buy a gun for the tortillas, a family built on shootings?
and to top it all off, you've got bill tortilla to contend with.
he's one half of the tortillas. he's the roughest guy in town.
i see.
that seven-foot-tall hulk of a man is the brother of the tortillas.
that's right!
i'll tell you what, let's get the hell out of town.
... hmm? that's about the height of the building.
how do you know exactly how tall it is if you can't see it?
i can tell by the direction of the voice and the weight of your footsteps.
you're five and a half feet tall, a little on the heavy side, and three sizes...
huh?
you can tell that much?
just kidding.
... you're not cool.
hahaha.
well, i'd better get going.
i have to find a place to stay for the night...
there it is!
ouch...
oh, no!
thanks for the good riddance.
i'll take care of your dirty clothes first.
your eyes.
if you don't want to be seen, wrap a towel around yourself.
oh, thank you very much.
i'll wash you up.
you don't know what to do in a shower at someone's house.
... excuse me.
you're quite used to dealing with closed eyes, aren't you?
yeah, well...
my father had bad eyesight too.
well...
well, technically, he got worse.
he was a terrible father... he was a poor painter.
he used to paint naked women and sell them to tortillas for money.
but then he got sick and his eyesight got worse and worse.
it must have been a shock for the painter.
he lost his job, he lost his money, and he became desperate.
he even tried to use me as a model.
and to top it all off, he gambled away his debts and threw me in the river.
he's a terrible father, isn't he?
in the end... so...
so, mr. rene became a model?
yeah. yeah.
she was very persistent.
i mean, it wouldn't have made me much money, but...
well...
that's good...
i'm sure you must be very happy.
to be able to paint your daughter before she went blind.
mr. rene?
no, it's nothing.
i'm done with your back.
come on, turn around.
what about you, anyway?
why are you traveling with a gun?
and that eye...
it's no big deal.
i shot and killed a mobster who killed my parents.
i was kicked out of my hometown for it.
this eye...
it's a token of my guilt.
...
you mean they crushed my eyes?
how awful...
you're just avenging your parents!
there's nothing terrible about that, mr. rene.
it's no more tragic than any of your father's.
i'm an outcast who wanted blood.
you can't blame a man like that for what he's done to you.
why don't you just drop the gun?
why don't you give up your gun?
but...
then...
drop it?
all i have left...
all i have is a gun and a closed eye.
i'm gonna go make some dinner.
call me if there's any trouble.
it's a lie...
the kind of lie a beggar would tell to get attention.
of course it is...
oh!
you're done already?
it's just about ready too.
i'll show you to your seat.
thank you.
mr. rene, it's ready.
it smells good.
it smells like hamburger.
huh?
ms. rene...
damn it!
let go of me!
what the hell is wrong with you?
don't yell at me, renai.
i'm sure my brother told you what he wanted.
but that doesn't mean you have to do this.
don't. tortilla!
oh, dear.
can't you do something about that manly personality of yours?
oh, well.
i've got a buyer for you.
a buyer...?
the man who bought your father's painting liked you very much.
he wants to buy you as a model.
i'm so happy for you.
when the buyer arrives in a few hours, you'll be free of your debt.
i don't know.
i'm not sure how they'll treat you at the shipping yard.
huh?
you've got to be kidding me!
then who the hell are you!
huh?
it's no use, renai.
no one's going to come screaming at us in a warehouse on the outskirts of town.
that's right.
i can't complain about what they do to idiots.
if your father hadn't had an eye problem, i would've let him live.
what do you mean...
what do you mean...
since we'll probably never meet again, i'll tell you.
your father had an eye problem.
i told him i'd buy his next painting at a good price to help pay for his treatment.
i knew he wouldn't be comfortable with just a verbal agreement, so i prepared a contract.
but i was careless, too.
i used the wrong paper.
i didn't think he'd be able to see it.
the contract i signed...
i didn't realize that the contract i signed was a huge iou.
wait a minute... so you're saying...
what good is a painter if he can't see?
i felt sorry for him, so i sent him to the other side!
he's probably painting nude angels right now!
huh?
tee-hee.
the window was higher than i thought...
hey...
what the hell...?
siora?
oh no.
sorry to disturb you so late at night...
i'm here to see mr. rene.
i'm sorry to disturb you...
what?
this is the same strange closed eye i reported earlier!
what is it bill?
did he follow you?
i said i'd follow him...
he's got eyes...
it's the smell.
it's the smell of hamburger steak that renee made.
i followed it here...
it smells like boiled down carrion.
i felt so bad.
if we don't do something about it, our dinner will get cold.
please don't pull your guns on us.
can you please let me go peacefully?
......
bill.
oh.
if you're so stupid you can't see what's going on.
i'll give you a lead bullet to remind you.
you're a closed-eyed bastard, you know that?
sheila!
fuck you.
i shot you first.
you shot me first, sir.
bill?
get ready.
don't let him get away!
kill him!
what? what? i can't hit it!
what the hell is going on?
you can't pull a trigger that hard.
i can see where it's coming from.
whoa!
ow!
this guy!
it's not a closed eye!
it's a binding eye!
binding eyes...?
no way...
i've heard of it...
there was a gunman who killed all the mobsters in a town out of revenge...
they were afraid of his power.
they burned his eyes, sewed up his eyelids, and ran him out of town.
that poor gunfighter...
he's still out there shooting bad guys like a ghost.
that's him, isn't it?
the binding-eye shooter.
this kid...
no.
who's the one who can't see?
i think they call it closed eyes.
idiots.
let's get some light in here.
i think you'd better sit tight.
mr. rene.
we're in the dark.
it's closed-eyed darkness.
huh.
huh.
huh.
huh?
i'm alive...
but...
just me?
are you hurt?
mr. rene?
no.
oh, shit.
my family.
my family.
why is this happening?
how the fuck...?
you gotta be kidding me...
then why?
my father is dead!
wait, wait, wait.
please don't shoot me.
you're dead!
die!
why are you...
why did you...!
theora!
she killed my father...
mr. rene.
if you pull that trigger...
if you pull that trigger, you better be ready.
oh, my god.
oh, thank god.
theora, you say?
i hear you're looking for a job with us.
i'll give you your money's worth...
did you just say "why"?
you said, "why?"
that's ridiculous.
you don't know what you're doing.
you're no better.

fuck you.
hmm.
in the dark.
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
i told you it was fine.
you went out of your way to see me off.
you should've at least thanked me.
i did it on my own.
are you going to continue... shooting people.
yeah...
for my eyes.
......
that's quite a haul for a send-off.
yeah.
i'm leaving town too.
it's just too depressing to stay here.
so...
where are you going?
where you're going.
aren't you glad?
no, you're not.
you're living on blood.
if you're with someone like me...
cheap sympathy...
don't get me wrong.
i don't know what happened to you in the past.
i don't expect you to back off.
you're allowed to cook for your benefactor again, right?
but...
you know what?
we're both lonely.
to be on the road alone.
come on...
the train's leaving
the wings of my dreams
i've got my dream wings waxed
the higher i fly
the sun will melt them.
well, then...
it's better not to fly at all.
someday you will.
it will fail!
the manned rocket "asagao" will explode!
it will fall to the earth.
japan's first manned space flight has failed!
balloon dream
mitsuki kutaka
ten years later - summer
jin aikawa
you have the academic ability to go to a top university.
so why are you aiming for a recommendation from a third-rate university?
you really have no dreams.
dream...? nonsense.
if there's an easier and safer way, why don't you take it?
am i wrong?
very good, aikawa...
aikawa... it's easy to ask a pretty little student like you
it's easier to ask for things from a student like you.
?
you're going to help out with our astronomy club during the summer break.
you'll be helping out with our astronomy club during the summer break.
?
hey!
why are you helping an unrelated club activityーー
well, listen.
i know you like to knock on stone bridges...
but if you don't go into a tiger's hole, you won't get a tiger.
that's what the teacher wants to teach you.
that's why i need you to run the astronomy club while i'm at the spa.
you just want to travel!
damn it!
why am i doing this...
if you don't help me, i won't give you a recommendation
isn't that blackmail?
... astronomy club
here.
excuse me...
hmm?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
what the hell is this?
... balloons?
i'm sorry, it's a mess right now.
are you one of the helpers?
welcome!
welcome to the astronomy club full of balloons and dreams!
nice to meet you!
i'm mizuki sonoyama, the head of the club!
you're aikawa-san, right?
i'm looking forward to working with you.
no.
it's nice to meet you too!
what's with this guy...
is there no one else in the club?
i'd like to get right to the point...
i want to go home!
ta-da!
with balloons.
we're going to send the camera into space!
a camera?
with balloons.
i saw it on tv once!
a balloon sends a camera into space...
and then the balloon broke, and it parachuted down...
when the camera was recovered, it took a picture of the earth!
see? isn't that very exciting?
what?
what's with the little help from that idiot teacher?
what's the matter with you?
?
besides...
that's why we need lots of balloons.
i'm sure you'll be fine.
you know what?
no matter how many balloons you collect, there's no way they'll float!
ugh!
he's definitely an idiot.
.......?
what are you doing?
i'm not sure what to make of this.
what's with the disposable camera?
oh.
it was cheap, so...
are you going to wind the film in space and release the shutter?
damn.
it might be possible in principle, but...
there are plenty of pictures of earth on the internet.
you don't have to take them yourself...
yeah.
it's just that...
because my dream is
i want to become an astronaut and see the round earth.
this is the first step towards my dream.
that's why i really want to take a picture of myself.
i can talk about my dream like that.
only those who have never seen the end of their dreams.
if you're an astronaut, you know that.
ten years ago...
the launch of japan's first manned rocket "asagao" failed.
putting a man on a rocket with no significant payback...
the risks and costs go up.
a lot of people suffered because of the failure.
manned space flight is
it's a fool's errand.
i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to say that.
it's okay.
but for me...
it's still an important dream to me.
i'll help...
i'll help you.
recommendation...
i have to get it.
wow, what a sight!
the camera is really flying!
i can't believe i can already take pictures of the earth with this thing: .....!
no, you can't.
i told you today was just a test shooting.
is that so?
listen to me carefully!
it's too hard to fly high right off the bat.
we need to get a feel for it...
the real test will be in the stratosphere at an altitude of 30,000 meters using large balloons that can withstand a decrease in atmospheric pressure.
it'll be swept away by the air currents.
i'm going to put a gps on it and try to find the drop point.
this time, we'll pull the taco line and retrieve it in a little while.
oh... i see.
......
mr. aikawa.
hmm?
i'll help you.
i really appreciate it.
thank you very much.
......
i had to go to .... for a recommendation!
what?
i don't know.
i have a weird feeling...
oh, no.
this is...
the string is broken...
there's nothing i can do about it...
what should i do?
i have to chase it...
i don't care.
it's just a 2,000 yen toy camera.
besides, it'll just end up in the mountains or in the field around here.
it'll cost us more to find it.
so no.
because it's got my...
my most precious thing...
... you.
did you put something in there?
i'm sorry! i really need to get this up into space.
it's very light...
but i'm sure you'll object.
of course not!
i've calculated the weight properly!
you can't just...!
aikawa-san...
i...
i'll go look for it.
if you've been listening to me...
you're always saying vague things.
i can't keep up with you!
you balloon woman!
she always goes looking for us after work...
really...
you idiot.
......
what's with the dreams?
i'm home.
welcome home, dad!
jin.
you're still awake?
you're not home at all...
you've been working too hard.
is that so? well, i can't help it.
the morning glory...
it's your father's dream.
he collapsed from a heart attack. that's right.
even if he was in charge of the rocket development, he must have taken a lot of flak for it...
japan's first launch stumbled.
that's the worst possible ending.
i'm sure in the afterlife
i'm sure he'll wish he hadn't done it.
oh...
aikawa-san?
you're still here?
sonoyama...?
you're all wet.
huh?
today...
i couldn't find him.
?
whoa!
you.
you're running a fever!
don't look for it until it's like this!
why are you wasting your time like this...!
i'll just go to the infirmary...
......
no.
it's not a waste of time...
whoa.
because...
my...
my...
it's my dream.
sonoyama...
......
i'm sorry.
mr. aikawa.
i think i'm going to throw up.
ugh.
wait, sonoyama!
huh?
i'm on my way back from a trip, so i want to relax!
you're my advisor, you should at least give me a ride!
damn.
at any rate, i've secured the legs to the drop point.
i'm getting ready for the launch!
you're not very excited, are you?
ugh... i was in bed with a cold, and before i knew it, it was launch day!
we couldn't find the prototype after all...
i can't help it.
there was something in it that i really wanted to put into space...
hey!
look at me.
this is it.
that's the important stuff you put in there.
it was sold ten years ago.
it's a limited-edition key chain from "asagao."
i was curious.
i wondered what it was that you were so obsessed with.
that's why i searched for it while you were asleep.
i didn't think you were going to take a picture of the earth
i didn't think you were going to make a memorial service for your rocket while taking pictures of the earth.
aikawa-san...
here!
i'll put it up, so let's get ready!
it's important to me too...
it's very important to me.
... one thing.
let me ask you something.
you have that key chain.
you saw it too, right?
the morning glory falling.
how can you say
how can you say you want to be an astronaut?
the "morning glory" that was the dream of so many people
it was just a fake wing made of wax.
you'd feel uneasy if you saw them.
if you fail, you'll lose everything.
you'd be afraid...
setbacks...
regret.
what if my wings...
what if my wings aren't real?
it's not.
fake wings.
when you can't fly.
what really hurts is when you break a wing.
it must be
because it's a real wing
even that pain is proof that you were flapping
that's why i have
i'll never regret it
even if i die, i won't regret it.
there it is...
there it is!
i wonder if it really went up to space.
what the hell?
are you doubting me?
no! that's not why...
no, it's not.
we'll find out when we see what's inside.
the earth was blue.
it's like...
huh?
haha...
hahahahahahahahahahaha!
what?
did i say something funny?
no, sorry.
i really didn't think
i didn't think i could take a picture with a balloon.
ah!
aikawa-san.
hmm?
thank you very much.
i'm an idiot, so i had to rely on you.
even though i was just being selfish...
you even let me carry your treasures...!
really...
it's okay.
i'm sure it's nothing.
it's no big deal.
it's nothing compared to this view.
i'm sure it's nothing compared to this view.
i'll stop recommending.
i'll study harder and make something.
i'll make a rocket that can take even an idiot like you into space.
i'll...
i'll build it.
huh?
how dare you call me an idiot!
you!
you just said so yourself!
wow...
thank goodness it's not in my neighborhood.
excuse me...
welcome!
oh... please give me some medicine...
i'm in such a pinch!
what's wrong? do you have a stomachache?
ugh...
the rice ball i found... if you eat it...
i got a nappy...
food poisoning...
here, i'll lend you the bathroom. why don't you go rest?
sorry to bother you...
well...
the live-in worker's store burned down.
you said you were stranded and had to scavenge...
i'm sorry to bother you.
i'm sorry you had to go through that.
you feel better now?
yeah!
oh, yeah! i'll pay for the drinks.
yeah, you don't have to...
what?
what?
i don't have a wallet...
oh, no...
...
if you don't have a choice, why don't you work for me?
no?
i can get you food and a place to sleep... if that's okay.
that's more than enough.
i owe you my life.
you're exaggerating.
what's your name?
mel.
i don't know where to start!
yeah!
i'll see you tomorrow.
okay.
it's hot, so don't burn yourself.
oh... delicious... it's so good...
i'm glad i didn't have a stomach ache...
you're glad?
well... i guess it was good.
thank you for the meal.
i'm going to do my best to be useful.
oh, and the alarm clock...
do you like frogs?
yeah.
good night.
what?
an alarm clock...
what a heinous volume...
i don't know how you can sleep with that sound...
hey, it's morning.
wake up...
...
maybe he's tired.
i'll wake you up a little later.
hey.
good morning.
what?
it's already this late!
huh? but...
i set it properly yesterday.
i wonder if it's broken?
no, it was beeping loudly.
i really didn't notice...
okay.
i think i'll ask you to clean up the leaves.
i got it!
good morning, sir.
oh, you want to help?
yes! are you shopping, grandma?
she's doing well...
you can come by if you want.
come on in.
come on in.
come on in.
is this...
is this going to attract customers?
i'll have them clean it when there's more traffic...
come again!
a few days later...
manager!
here.
don't you like sweets?
grandma said you can have some too!
i'm sorry...
since mel came, we've had a few more customers.
really?
i'm doing something right?
of course.
i'm glad.
i'm glad!
i'll keep working hard!
manager! is this my apron?
yeah, i made it last night.
it's amazing! it's got a frog on it!
now i look like a shopkeeper.
i need you to do some shopping for me today.
money and a note.
i put a little extra money in there for you.
why don't you go buy something for yourself, mel?
tencho...
i'm counting on you.
i'm off!
i'm home.
welcome home.
oh no... i asked too much... sorry...
bye!
i bought you a souvenir.
huh?
let's eat it together later.
and you know what?
i want you to be healthy forever.
here's a good luck charm.

thank you.
by the way... by the way.
what did you buy for yourself?
that's for us to eat together, right?
ha-ha-ha.
let's go buy something for mel next time.
yeah!
....
are your hands cold?
it's okay!
i'm so excited to go shopping with you.
yeah, i am.
i'll have to buy some clothes for mel.
yeah!
you know what?
i want my clothes to be big!
if it's big enough, you can wear it when you're taller.
you know... i see...
i wonder if it'll grow...
is there anything else you want?
well...
that thing for peeling vegetables...
peeler?
that's it!
i'm not very good with a knife.
i'm not very good with a knife, but i can peel vegetables with a peeler.
then i can help out more with the cooking.
i can be more helpful to the manager!
manager?
do the onions sting?
yeah, the onions...
i was so sick i had to go to the drugstore.
thanks.
that'll look good on you.
pick your own, huh?
this boy i just happened to hire.
he'd lost his job and his place to live in the fire.
the only thing he had on him was a backpack.
that's all his stuff?
no.
just a few clothes and an alarm clock.
still, she works hard every day with a smile on her face.
i'm sure you'll be happy to know that i did a lot of shopping today.
manager!
look at this!
it's a frog hat!
it's nice and warm, isn't it?
want to try it on?
huh?
it looks good on you.
you look like a frog.
how cool is it?
what?
oh... yeah, it is.
cool... what do you mean...?
yeah, yeah.
isn't this a good idea?
it's gonna get cold. you need a coat, right?

i don't know if this is the right outfit.
what are you talking about?
it's gonna be cold if you don't get it right.
it's got a quilted lining.
and...
isn't this nice too?
it's... it's a little girly, don't you think?
is it? it's easy to throw on.
it'll be fine when you're taller.
that's great.
i'm gonna get you a sweater or something to keep you warm.
i don't know if i should wear it now.
i'll cut off the price tag.
excuse me.
let's go to the cookware store next.
yes, tencho.
you want a peeler, right?
yeah.
let's buy mel's teacup too.
go look for it?
yeah!
!
you're getting rid of...?
oh, look, a frog ornament.
you want one?

yeah... but...
but what good is it if i buy it?
they probably left it behind because they don't need it.
is that so?
i'd like to have it.
a frog ornament is good luck.
maybe it'll bring good luck to the store.
hey, manager.
mr. frog, you were so sad just now.
but now you look happy.
i guess so.
maybe he's happy to have a place to stay.
yeah.
he's just like me.
same?
yeah, we're the same.
oh, my...
you look happy...
manager, i'll take care of the peeling.
i'll take care of the peeling.
i'll buy some vegetables that are easy to peel with a peeler...
do you want to practice cutting them with a knife?
i don't know if i can.
i'll teach you. just try it.
okay...
....
tencho...
i don't think i can do it...
i'll lose my fingers...
... cat's paw first.
cat's paw?
hold down the vegetables to hide the claws...
that's right.
hold the knife like you're grabbing the blade from above.
hold the blade in your left hand.
push the blade to the back.
... i think i can do it...
that's it.
i'll take it.
....
the vegetables are huge.
it's really good, isn't it?

it's already this late...
it's getting later than i thought.
mel... did you eat dinner?
mel...?

i'm worried about you, so wait for me at home next time.

i have a hat.
you forgot your...
here.

okay.
it's... it's not too small?

i thought i was losing money all the time.
what's wrong with you?
yeah!
i'm splitting it with the umbrella store manager!
yeah.
oh... well, that's good.
are you cold?
yeah.
the manager's with me.
the funeral director.
people aren't equal.
but...
death comes to everyone equally.
then...
say your final goodbyes to the deceased.
oh, no.
i didn't expect this.
i didn't expect this many people to show up.
oh!
that's the mom from the snack bar in ichome!
and over there is the proprietress of my favorite restaurant.
i'm still a popular guy!
i'm still very popular!
what is a funeral director?
a funeral director is a person who creates a final resting place for the living and the dead.
it's a job... i'm one of them.
i'm one of them.
i'm dead, aren't i?
welcome, ghost funeral director.
i'm the one who can see.
what?
you made up your dead sister's makeup?
president of karasuma funeral home... 25 years old.
yes...
funeral client suzume sakurano, 19.
angel makeup.
that's what you call it, right?
i know it's impossible.
but i really wanted to...
i really wanted to do makeup on my sister...
really?
i'm not a pro yet, but...
but i'm a make-up artist studying at a vocational school!
i can do it! karasuma-san!
you shouldn't do that.
!
i've never seen her alive, but...
i'm sure she had a beautiful face.
why?
suzume.
i heard that your sister was a famous and beautiful actress.
it's been all over the media every day.
i don't know... i'm not good enough.
i'm not good enough to do my sister's makeup?
that's not why.
did you see your sister's face after the accident?
did you see it?
i'm sure you have.
no... no.
the hospital said
they said i shouldn't look too closely...
the current sakuranotou swallow...
she doesn't look like anyone you know.
a car accident.
a head-on collision with a guardrail at excessive speed.
her face was torn to shreds by the broken windshield.
broken bones poking through the skin.
she's in the hospital, but they're treating her pretty well.
but no one would recognize her as the woman she was before she died.
i can't do it after seeing her face.
i can't do that.
..... i am.
what do you think?
but still...
are you ready to face your sister now?
hey, funeral director!

don't pick on suzume too much!
she's my sister!
... swallows.
you're the one who asked me to do this.
of course i did!
i don't want suzume to see me like that!
i'm used to being hated by others.
but i don't want my sister to be attracted to me.
i don't know if that's how it is...
don't let suzume wear your makeup.
she said.
but why don't you think about suzume's feelings too?
they're the only two people in your family.
you...
what do you know?
anyway!
i don't approve!
you'll have to find someone else!
and...
and?
and... it's nothing!
...... who wouldn't?
to say goodbye with so many regrets
i'm sure you'll be sad to say goodbye.
hey!
a beautiful actress, tsubame sakuranot, died in a car accident.
there are a lot of rumors in the world.
what do you think?
there's also a rumor that she was killed by someone.
she was a bit of an oddball in the entertainment industry.
what do you mean?
well, you know, pillows and .... it's a rumor.
it's just a rumor.
and to be honest, she's not very likable, is she?
her face and acting skills are good, but...
but the inside is ...... you know what?
after this.
we'll continue our investigation into the truth behind mr. sakuranototsubame's death.
oh!
i was watching you.
suzume!
take this to table 4!
thank you for waiting!
here you go.
... huh?
huh?
a funeral director?
yes.
the ramen was delicious.
wasn't it?
it's our pride and joy!
so you earn your own money while attending a vocational school?
i can't take a day off because i need money to go to school.
i'm trying to make it as easy as possible on her...
....
oh...!
!
shall we go?
what?
where to?
where your sister is now.
this place...
ghosts...
they have a specific place to stay.
the first is where they died.
the second is where their remains are buried.
and the third is...
the third is near someone you love.
you know.
actually, i'm here.
sister.
hmm.
do funeral directors make jokes too?
please call me kururu.
kururu-san...
huh?
you don't have any bad thoughts about my sister?
there's a lot of rumors...
rumors are rumors, right?
you can ask her the truth.
mr. cardinal is very interesting.
...... i'm in.
i was in the car just before the accident.
i was driving my sister's car.
i was on my way home from work.
the forecast was for cloudy skies and heavy rain...
i was busy with my own work.
she said, "it's my birthday, let's go out to eat."
he came to pick me up.
but i had a fight with my sister.
... about school fees.
i wanted to go to school on my own money.
but...
but she wouldn't let me pay for everything.
my parents died.
i didn't want to give my sister any more trouble than she already gave me.
i didn't want to cause her any more trouble...
you're still a child.
that's what she said.
it pissed me off.
hey! suzume!
i jumped out of the car.
i hate you.
you're my sister!
that was the last thing
that was the last thing i said to her.
your accident.
she was driving too fast, wasn't she?
i think she was chasing me.
after i left the car and ran.
after i got out of the car and started running, it started raining like crazy.
... my dream.
my dream was to do makeup for my sister on stage.
but
but it's no longer possible.
because of me.
because of me...
she's dead.
until the very end.
i caused you so much trouble... no.
i... you don't get to decide if you're bothering her or not.
isn't something you can decide for yourself.
how is it really?
swallows.
was it annoying?
....?
if i thought you were annoying.
i wouldn't be there for you.
you know that better than anyone, don't you?
she said.
...... it's strange.
i just saw my sister for a second.
cardinal...
can i ask you again?
if you're ready to accept everything from your sister...
i'm ready.
hey...
can i open my eyes now?
yes!
today's makeup...
i'm proud of it!
i'm... huh?
hahaha!
i suck at it.
i... i tried so hard.
it'll be a long time before you can be my personal makeup artist.
i can be too!
you'll be my sister's make-up artist!
come on.
life isn't that easy.
when you can do makeup that satisfies me.
i'll consider it.
i'll reward you when the time comes.
really?
so keep working on your skills.
so polish up your skills!
swallows.
you're beautiful.
..... i'll always be beautiful.
what are you sulking about?
i wasn't even around you, sparrow.
of course you weren't!
i didn't want suzume to see my face like that.
you never intended to fulfill my request from the start.
i'm sure you didn't.
if it was a real request of yours.
i did.
what...?
cardinal?
thank you very much!
thanks to you.
i can send my sister off without regrets.
sir...
here...
the makeup brush you borrowed.
i'll return it.
!
that...
this belongs to you, suzume.
suzume?
...... my sister.
this is the birthday present my sister...?
it's the birthday present i was going to give you.
the swallows.
i'm sure she was going to give it to you over dinner.
it was found outside the car.
it was found outside the car, and we've been holding on to it as part of your sister's belongings.
of all the things that happened in the accident.
this one was miraculously unharmed.
it must have been
i'm sure your sister was protecting you.
..... i'll never thank you.
you're a stubborn one too.
it's none of your business.
hey, hey.
..... why?
isn't it hard?
you're doing this job.
seeing someone's face cry every day.
offering condolences to people you don't even know.
... not really.
you...
you can smile, can't you?
i... yeah.
you're a nosy funeral director.
i... thank you.
...the sound of civilization...
the dark night has been lifted
there will be no end to the demons and evil spirits
no
the more humanity's light covers the world
delusion, the source of demons, will spread throughout the world.
wu ye
...
... your will
for that
we are the luosheng hunt
rapture hunters
koya arato
i will push you

mitsuki kutaka
it seems that zaito has done it all by himself again.
the atmosphere of evil demons drifting around
what a grudge!
he must have been a very powerful demon.
but
as expected of a demon hunter from a great onmyoji family
that huge demon was burnt to a crisp
he's as strong as a demon god
if you call him a demon god, he'll kill you
ever since my family was eaten by a demon
i've always hated demons.
but you're not wrong.
his eyes.
there's definitely a demon in his heart.
if you're saying he has a demon in his heart...
that's...
stop it!
it must have been that day.
let go of chord!
nii...
sama...
stop it...
please stop...
ah...
ahh...
ah?
how dare you?
how dare you...
your father...
mother...
chords...!
can we please stop this?
visiting tombs like this
kureha.
such offerings...
every time you kill a demon
i offer my finger to the grave...!
....
it's for the family.
look at the graveside, covered in gore.
is this how you pay your respects...!
do you think it will bring peace to your parents and sister?
wu ye.
i'm grateful to you for serving the zaito family as a shikigami for generations.
but...
but this wound on my hand and the vow i made to my late family to avenge them
you cannot stop me.
you don't know the tingle of a wound.
not you.
you can tell me...
even i...
i hate demons.
i was caught off guard that day, and i couldn't protect you.
i still feel like i'm burning with regret.
but...
i'm more worried than that.
koya.
the way your eyes are getting cloudy.
hey, koya...
message!
message!
what's wrong?
the demon outbreak is spreading!
we need backup immediately!
yes, sir.
i'm on my way.
damn...
nao nao!
the target is identified as the evil demon that attacked the imperial city ten years ago.
target demon number.
kagamaru
kagamaru...
kagamaru... brush mirror...
ah, koya.
your eyes...
it's like...
it's the real deal.
let's go, kureha.
tonight, i will fulfill my long-cherished wish.
you look like a demon.
ha!
nonsense...
it took a dozen or two elite defeaters...
and they're all wiped out...?
you...
you monster!
it's been a while since i've been to the imperial capital.
it's not at all crunchy.
isn't this all-you-can-eat?
hgh!
huh?
there's nothing left to eat.
ow!
the people around here...
i've eaten them all.
your family's in my belly.
you hate me?
hate me. hate me.
it's hate that gives me the most pleasure.
ta...
help me...
hmm.
you're killing me.
what is he?
he's a rakshasa hunter.
koya arato
i've waited ten years for my family's revenge.
i'm going to send you to hell myself.
kagamemaru!
zaito...?
you.
that zaito?
the little kid we left behind ten years ago.
he's become quite tasty.
i can't stop drooling with joy.
zaito...
kureha.
thank you.
whoa!
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
kureha's "extreme flame" that she wore to bury you.
that pain will not go away easily.
this scar on my hand was carved ten years ago.
until this tingle subsides.
until this pain subsides, savor it to your heart's content!
koya, you're getting too excited, calm down a bit.
the other party is the cunning demon who took me and your father by surprise ten years ago.
watch out!
watch out!
don't worry.
ten years of anger.
it won't be so easy.
aah...
blah, blah, blah.
scared.
how dare you...
how dare you.
you fostered hatred.
it was worth it to spit on it then.
i've never seen hatred mature to this level.
the perfect ingredient.
zaito...
i want to eat you in the best way possible.
hmm.
that wish.
know that you'll never get it!
then...
how about this?
brother...
i can conjure my sister... no!
koya!
nonsense.
such deception...
my sword will not be dulled by such deception.
even though it's just an illusion... my sister's face...
awesome will...!
but...
without hesitation like this...?
squeak!
khihihi!
that's good, zaito.
the best!
your obsession.
this looks great!
this is not a delusion!
this is righteousness!
this is righteousness for the family!
how dare you talk about family love!
who can cut up his sister like this?
zaito!
look!
look only at me.
your obsession.
reveal it all to me.
damn!
whoa...
whoa, whoa, whoa!
hiroya!
what's going on?
this is...
zhangqi is being sucked into the old wound!
i want to eat zaito...
i want to eat him in the best way possible.
bastard...
you're trying to turn hiroya into an evil demon!
kagamaru!
emotion is at its most fervent the moment a person is consumed by it.
koya, listen to my voice!
when the blade of hatred pierces me, and the delusion of revenge takes over you...
you'll become an evil demon and become one with me, zaito!
pull yourself together, koya!
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
that's right, come on.
the next sword!
with the next sword...
i'll eat you!
i'll eat you!
ah?
ahh...
ah!
give me that.
huh...
ah...
ah?
ahhhhhhh!
i've lost interest.
a shikigami like you is making a bad move.
i'm not going to let you get away with this.
well...
now fall down!
the hunt for the rapture
a curse i placed on you ten years ago.
it's not so easy to remove
father
mother
chord...
what's the matter?
you're wearing a demon mask.
take it off.
let's see your face...
to... you...
you're a...
demon... i'll kill you!
huh? !
don't do that!
huh...
hana...
no...
no, no...
it's swallowing me!
this...
you...
you idiot!
gah... huh?
you fell for that stupid curse!
but you're still a legitimate son of the zaito family!
idiot!
why are you the one who was cut down...!
...
huh?
why? you're asking crazy things.
why?
the lord is in danger.
a single sword is not enough to keep you awake.
the wound.
you burned it!
be careful.
well...
i had to endure it for a bit.
but... give me...
you're starting to come to your senses.
you...
you're a god of ceremony.
i've been living for a hundred years and you're in my way!
he's used this much magic on his own.
hundred years?
don't get carried away with a hundred years, kagamaru.
i've been a shikigami for 1,000 years since the heian era.
even if i am inferior to you in power...
this love...
i will not be defeated by delusion.
delusion covers all thoughts and feelings
don't be consumed by it
look at me
feel me.
remember your family by the scent on my body
don't ever forget them.
remember what was in your heart.
and...
that i'll always be there for you.
that's bullshit.
i'll never forgive you.
this is a farce.
what?
kegamaru.
i'm sorry...
from here on out.
you're on your own from here on out.
i'm sorry, kureha.
the wound... it hurts.
don't be so sure
i'm not trained so softly that i can't hold my ground here.
if that is so...
i beg you.
whoa, whoa, whoa!
what are you planning to do?
no way...
i will.
stop...
geez...
aaah!
ah...
the curse!
the precincts...
the delusion burns...
what a waste!
what a waste! what a waste!
what a waste, what a waste, what a waste...
it's a waste!
it's a waste!
the best of delusions.
a taste of what you've wasted
take it!
taste it!
the taste of delusion
i already know
forgetting the pain, drunk with hatred...
it was sweet indeed, kagamaru.
but...
i'm done.
i'm done.
i will not lose sight of my feelings.
kureha.
... what?
it's heavy.
that's what you're talking about? !
i'm not sure what to say, but the burn on my arm hurts, and i'm already exhausted.
at least make me a spirit...
hmm.
this is punishment.
it's punishment for pointing the blade at me.
this is what i'm going to do to you at home.
i'm going to have to put you on my back for a while
kureha...
i am weak.
i was vain when i defeated kakamaru.
i never know when i might lose sight of myself again and hurt you.
i'm no longer...
i am no longer qualified to handle you.
nonsense.
i know the weakness of a child now.
there will be times when you stray from the path on moonless nights.
i'm here for those times.
i have served zaito since the heian era.
a thousand years ago
chitose's thoughts...
this is your trial by fire!
i see...
i'll be damned.
well...
tomorrow we'll clean the graves!
hey, hey!
don't run so fast!
